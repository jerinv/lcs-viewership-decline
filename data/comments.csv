0,"LCS were hemorrhaging average viewers too, I think 125k average might be the lowest on record, although bare in mind that they extended the regular season to have 50% more games.

https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lcs-2021-summer"
1,I like watching NA for the fiestas but no shot I'm sitting around waiting to watch CLG vs GG at 1 am
2,"I'm from EU and think a lot has to do with the time these games start at. In earlier seasons I was watching a lot of NA but nowadays it starts so late I almost never bother to see it after watching LEC. I just go and do something else after LEC while before LCS would start right as LEC broadcast ended.

Perhaps the sponsors want it this way because they're mainly targeting NA audience, which is understandable, but yeah, I would guess a lot of us EU folks don't watch NA as often as we used to."
3,"Poor scheduling for EU viewers, consistently poor international performances, and the retirement of our best players in Bjerg, DL, Sneaky, etc have negatively affected the attractiveness of the LCS.


NA actually used to get more viewers than EU back during 2014-2017 too."
4,"Wow, LCK really almost flame horizoned LCS by 1mil. (364k vs 1,315m)"
5,"Yeah because it goes game finishes 5 minute commercials then 5 minute interview then 5 minute commercials then 15 minutes of analysis on a 30 minute game then 5 minute commercial caster desk 2 minutes pick ban 5 minutes game. I don’t even mind the in game advert shout-outs but it’s like they took the worst part of a football game (touchdown, commercial, xp, commercial, kickoff, commercial) and integrated it into every game.

After a game finishes I can load up an ARAM and they still won’t be onto the next game before my game finishes."
6,"Great points. I also think the LCS doesn't give any players the opportunity to shine and be interesting. Remember Abbedagge's winners interview? He tried to shittalk and have fun and the interviewer just weirded out and jumped back to FBI. And FBI gave the typical PR answers all the other players (except some europeans like zven, perkz, etc) give. Why would i wanna watch that? I was honestly really disappointed, since i really wanted to listen to Abbe after he won. He's been trying so hard"
7,"Starts at unconsistent timings, long breaks, interviews are straight up ass. Broadcast isnt fun outside of in game casting. Some dead weight talent needs to be let go. Broadcast is way too serious or it becomes ""cringe"" when it tries to be funny. It isnt able to balance itself. Very little NA players. Observers are actually blind. It just goes on and on. Whoever is managing the production and content is doing a poor job for 2 years in a row now. Plus the commissioners denial that LCS has low viewers due to covid hammers the nail in the coffin.

Kobe, Cpt Flowers and Dash are literally carrying this"
8,"No native big names anymore. Basically import league. Terrible international performance. Wait between games is like 30minutes. I've used to watch LCS every weekend, since season 2. I literally only tuned in for the final now. Half of the teams are just straight horrible and coasting by, which offers the top team no competition at all and keeps them stagnant skill level.

You can't have imports and still place last for a major region every time. Have to be imports and perform or no imports and have the backing of NA people. Also Solo Q isn't fun anymore either.

Im from NA if that matters."
9,No bjergsen no DL
10,"I haven't seen anyone mention how trash the observing is. Like the analyst desk, and especially the observing are lacking as hell. Interviews in early game where skirmishes, invades and dives are happening. I just can't stand the observing."
11,"Back in the day reddit used to say that EU has no personalities outside the rift. Then QTpie, Hai, Scarra, Sneaky, DL, Bjergsen and all the big personalities started to retire in NA and now we're at a point where most of the memorable personalities in NA are actually EU imports who built their brand through the LEC broadcast and content machine. Meanwhile NA does what exactly to showcase player personalities and build them up?"
12,"I'm one of the people who went from watching every single match to watching virtually none of them. C9's embarrassment at MSI was basically the last straw for me, I'm done deluding myself into thinking that LCS will be anything but a 3rd tier region. 

Having 4 or 5 imports on half the teams certainly doesn't help. At least if the players were NA players, I could have a sense of pride in that, even if we sucked. It's far more compelling to root for underdogs from a small region than to root for a hodge podge of second rate imports."
13,"LEC has grown cuz of international succes made by FNC and G2. Suddenly people want to see them fight because they may have a chance to win worlds. With NA struggling to get out of groups in worlds, LCS is just some internal competition with no stake at all.

Edit: typo"
14,"To me, it's just not enjoyable watching a league that's become the international retirement community. The winner of the LCS has ***ZERO*** native North Americans on the roster. That's an absolute travesty. 

Why should I give a shit about 100 Thieves as a North America fan? 

Between TSM, C9 and TL, there are only 4 native NA players. That's fucking shameful. And it's not like the results at Worlds have changed with all of these imports. NA teams are spending more money for the same, or sometimes, much worse results internationally.

I would watch NA again if the league was about NA players, but it's not. I just can't give two shits about imports who collect a fat check and still lose just as much as the native NA talent."
15,"Ah, shame. More people missed out on Jensen going 0-11 across the entire series. Truly one of the greats of NA mids. 2nd best after Bjergsen left."
16,"Kinda sad because they really stepped up on production this year, got a lot of new talent.  
But it starting way later than it used to + the fact I can take my dog for a walk, have a shower and make a 5 course meal during each break is really killing it."
17,Yeah as an east coaster I watched more eu than NA just because of the time. I can have it on while I work but come home exhausted and fall asleep to lcs
18,2 NA players (?) Between 2 teams and bad time slots for EU...who couldve thought
19,"Yeah maybe get rid of this USELESS and giga BORING segment of """"""analysis"""""" and pre show that last for almost 2 hours before the actual games start."
20,Glad the greed for evermore fucking ads is not paying off in viewership.
21,Import + Ad region. No soul and fueled by corporate greed with no regard for the region’s players? … no wonder NA league is dead.
22,"1. no stake, games are meaningless

2. the players are worse, no going around about it

3. it starts 12 pm for most european players, good luck with that

4. the production quality is just garbage, butter it up as you may

5. no personalities anymore, compare doublelift shittalk era to any new adc era. 

6. considered to be a retirement home for eu and korean players, why would you watch retired players play?

7. FTX gold advantage, statefarm analystdesk, etcetc you sold out to name every single thing after your sponsors."
23,"Import rule should be changed to 1 import per team, with no grandfathering. It's fine to have a few popular, high profile, and top tier imports, but the lenient import rules have caused organizations to shell out tons of money to field entire teams of old, past-their-prime imports who are only a little bit better than the native talent. It hasn't considerably increased the level of play/international performance and it's stripped the scene of personalities because so many of the players are either just here for a vacation or struggle to communicate in English. The native NA players that do exist are usually pushed into expendable role player slots, which makes it a lot harder for them to build a brand.

NA is considered the 4fun region and is known for its big streaming personalities and yet none of that is seen in the professional landscape. Credit to Spica trying his hardest this split but it's nowhere near enough and he's already talking about ditching LCS to play in the LPL.

A region can be bad internationally and still be popular/well-watched in its home region. Brazil has been bad even among wildcard teams for 6 years and still has thriving viewership."
24,"For me its just pointless. The level isn't great, but that isn't really the problem, as no one watched NA before for the level. 

The biggest problem for me is the format, having spring games carry over is dumb. Coupled with the 8 team playoff, it just allows teams like TL/C9 and others to fuck around all split since they'd legitimately have to lose something like 70%+ of their games to not make playoffs.. what is the point ???? Just have playoffs if you're gonna throw damn near all your teams in it anyway. It is just a waste of time to watch these games.

They also lost european viewers with the late starting hour, but I don't think that is the main problem. Games need some form of stakes to be fun ... there's so many games and the vast majority are irrelevant to the end result."
25,"I have zero interest in NALCS. It just feel like retirement home for kr/eu players who wish to play for money and money alone, disregarding any competitive success. Which is understandable, but I have no interest in that if the players themselves aren't playing to win."
26,"With the amount of imports they have I feel people from NA don't really care for their domestic league. It feels like a half assed international competition without the pride you would get by watching full teams of national talent and then sending them off to worlds.

The production also sucks major ass, you can barely recognise any caster whereas in Europe all of them have their spotlight to entertain outside of the games and the interviews are awkward as fk"
27,I don' t watch LCS because it' s an import league.
28,If I wanted to watch Eu players I'd just watch lec
29,"I did watch LCS in the first 2-3 years, but for the past years I just can’t watch it for a longer time. 

1) The quality of matches is very low, bottom-tier teams tend to just do nothing until they lose and in high-stake matches both teams play giga scared. 

2) The pauses between matches is so fucking long. The game ends and 20 minutes pass until the next one is even in champ select.

3) The analyst desk is a snooze fest. Most of the people on there lack personality or knowledge, some even both. Compare that to Caedrel,Sjokz, Vedius and others in EU - NA is just nothing special in this regard. 

4) The casting in itself is fine imo, but the casters can only do so much with the games they are presented with.

5) Absolutely zero hype for games. It doesn’t feel like the league or even particularly some teams even care a lot about the games. No storylines, no emotions, just blank imo.

6) The format this year was just absolutely atrocious. No one can differentiate how a team1 with 32-12 is doing vs team2 of 26-16. Needs to go back to the old format, even though even that one is flawed with the non-importance of spring split."
30,no drops for EU viewers rip
31,"LCS just feels so lame now. All the most popular players have retired, I don't want to hear about Tactical's longest sheesh or how TSM have the power of the friendship. 

Analyst desk is just so lame and I just don't care to listen to Letigress or Crumbz. Co-streams have definitely helped with that but it's obviously hard for Sneaky, Meteos and Doublelift to find topics to talk about between every single 20 minute break.

But the biggest reason is definitely the level of LCS. Literally every game is just slowly playing for dragon soul every single game, and it's just boring to watch. Everybody knows that won't work on the international stage and there's no hope to even care anymore because there's no personalities."
32,"As someone that lives in NA, the futility of international play has broken me. A coworker who is a C9 fan was talking to me after C9 eliminated TSM and my legitimate feelings at the time (and still) are thank god I don’t have to go watch TSM get embarrassed internationally again.

It’s just really hard to get excited about a region that isn’t ever going to go farther than it did in 2013 and has no prospects for doing so in the near future."
33,Posted on EU hours. This thread is gonna be painful for NA. Rip in pepperoni
34,i didnt even watch it. its all been downhill since i got a league tattoo in 2014 i think its my fault
35,Imports is death of LCS
36,"Fairly predictable, all of the iconic faces of the LCS are gone, and no one has really stepped up to replace them (Perkz is trying, but he has way too much history with EU to ever really be associated with NA). No iconic players also means no hype narratives, so even matchups that should in theory draw in tons of views like C9 vs. TSM don't carry the same weight they used to. There's also no getting around the fact that years of international failure have hurt the region. Despite constant promises to perform, despite constantly hyping themselves up, we all know how these teams perform at worlds.

IMO 2016 TSM was the beginning of the end, it felt like the hype was higher than it ever had been, the promises from the team were pretty crazy (top 4 minimum btw), and all we got was the infamous 3-3. I'm not certain, but I think after that was when NA viewership began its decline, we've just been burned one too many times by unrealistic promises."
37,Too many imports+lack of international success. also casters are really annoying other than flowers.
38,"I don't watch NA anymore because all the players are washed up imports. 

EU has more relatable personalities."
39,"The broadcast is brutal to watch

christ, not everything needs a sponsor"
40,You mean I don’t want to watch a 2 hour pre-game show and a 30 minute break between games? Turning what should take ~2 hours in total for a BO5 into 5 hours is ridiculous
41,"We’ve just seen a team with 0 native NA players win the split, might be contributing to the apathy around pro league in North America."
42,"Reasons I see:

- *Cringeworthy* level of advertising and shilling. Everything is sponsored. EVERYTHING. I actually sighed when I saw the *gold lead* is now sponsored.

- Recent retirement of many big names around the same time

- International performance; other regions don't want to watch NA because they're simply bad.

- Moving to timeslots which are really bad for EU"
43,LCS is dying for real
44,No relegations is also pretty boring imo anyway. I hate to always see the same teams which mostly perform as you expect them too instead of bringing in new blood and faces.
45,Tbh it's not going to go up unless LCS teams start showing up internationally.
46,"If they cared, they would move the LCS to earlier hours so Europe can watch more of it. Having games start at 11 or often midnight Berlin time is just a deal breaker. By that time, you're already spent and low on energy and you then try to endure the fiesta that is NA at late hours. No thanks.

Move it to 9 PM start, that's noon for NA, I'm sure everyone would be able to handle that. And if the LEC and LCS overlap for 1 or 2 games, it's no the end of the world. The LCS could put their marquee matches later in the day so they don't overlap with G2/FNC games that are always in the last 2-3 games of the day for LEC.

Also, bring back Best of 3 format. That was a much better way of seeing who the best team in the region is. You could have a string of bad games because of bad starts that you can't recover from, but you might win all of those best of 3s."
47,From NA. The games are boring AF. EU masters is more exciting to watch than LCS.
48,"It is because of Covid
COPIUM"
49,"NA being a wildcard region at Worlds for the last few years was always going to bite eventually. As an EU fan, I gave up watching LCS a year or two ago because it didn't seem to be a competitive region any more. I'd rather spend my non-LEC time watching LCK or LPL which is a shame because NA still has the best casters of any region IMO."
50,"it's by far the most uninteresting and boring league of the 4 ""major regions"". also best of 1 format is dogshit."
51,"Honestly just got tired of watching games about who throws hardest. I wanted to see good league of legends, as a C9 fan I wanted to see them beat other amazing teams because they played better. Watching just inexplicable bullshit for so long with no accountability and no long term improvement in the LCS just turned me off completely."
52,I will be completely honest..  it starts late.. too many delays and before the game discussions about x and y team or players.. then you have side games between casters.. then you have some interviews with some ex players or some people I don't even know... then goes back to more discussions then the game starts after few ads... and when the game starts even its their best teams like TL or Clown9 it's so boring to watch.. low talent.. borning games.. trying to copy other regions but failing.. they're so out of personality.. it used to be great back in I think 2018 2017 used to be so much fun the list goes on and on.. its just boring to watch mostly though..  I'd rather watch HLE vs LSB lck and I'm not even an LCK fan.. I think it's a boring region too.. LPL and LEC are hands down the best regions to watch and have so much talent there.. did you watch fnc vs g2? It was insane!! It was so much fun to watch.. Mad vs fnc? I love those kinda games... watching LCS is like watch silver viewers championship on twitch..
53,Ive watched LCS all year but Its not good! the game quality is average at best before the games the production and alot of the on-air personalities are shocking! its hard to enjoy it out not taking the teams to seriously because most of them suck
54,Dead game in NA. Even soloq is dead. I m tired of waiting 10 minutes for a game .
55,"I used to watch LCS religiously, but have really fallen off the last two years. For me it is simply, not fun to watch and the casters seem to be getting worse. I now just try to watch LEC, since it is more fun, there are more stories, more interesting picks and better overall cast. Also, for some reason, honestly no idea where it came from, I have a seething hatred for TL. I am not even a fan of a single team, just the game in general. I just really do not like the org for some reason. Anyone else have that for any other team?"
56,"I watched C9 in playoffs and a few DIG games but that's about it. NALCS Finals had 1 NA player attend. The amount of imports is crazy and is making me care a lot less about LCS, why watch lcs when I can just watch LCK/EUs best teams instead? Watched more of T1/Geng/FNC games than any other year."
57,I remember back then when NALCS was better to watch than EU LCS and everyone agreed that the EU broadcast is. Unwatchable. How the turns have tabled
58,"Starts too late + the breaks between the games are insanely long 

But the biggest thing for me is that the region is just so bad that even team with Ssumday and Huhi can win it all. Yes, I dont consider 100T a good team in any way so the fact that they are actually the best NA can offer is just depressing."
59,"My friends and family had tickets to go to this event in NJ this year. Bought plane tickets, rented an Air BnB, even had team Jerseys made up. 7 of us. Then less than a month before the LCS, they cancel the event. Cost me around $500 in non-refundable things. To say I'm upset is an understatement.  


It was a good series though, we tried to watch it together on Discord but it wasn't the same."
60,The games start so late fo EU viewers
61,"Nice. I personally stoped watching LCS this season. Lets be honest your league is just boring, and bad."
62,"I don't think it's 100% reason why viewership has been gettin' worse each year but I personally think it has something to do with International success.  Why am I or any casual viewer going to spend time watching something that isn't good in the grasp of things?  Why invest into something that gets s$it on at every tournament?

Apart from International topics and NA LCS alone :  The LCS has no hype, no cool videos - I mean, the TL vs 100 Thieves Finals video was literally the same video they did a week prior but with the Perkz/C9 clips cut out.  Week 1 the LCS did the "" Around the horn"" ripoff which was fine and all but they have done such EACH. AND. EVERY. WEEK. Since.  Not to mention but my god, the Vienna sausage anime girl showing up has been really annoying.  They take something that gets a little bit of laughs or applauds and run it into the ground.  Reruns get old quick.

OG players.  I'm a OG viewer: I've been an active viewer of the LCS on a regular basis since 2014 but now I don't care as much because many/damn near all of the players that I grew up with watching, studying, looking at their streams etc are either retired or bad.  Not to mention I was in my late teenage years when I started watching league, I not going to spend another 5-6 years for these new blood of players to peak my attention.  Once something that was once good, fun and enjoyable isn't fun, good or enjoyable it's time to quit or watch less.  The magic is gone.  I grew up with the game itself but now it feels as if I'm growing up and moving on like many pro players before me.

The game and atmosphere feels a bit too childish.  The champions seem more catering to teenage girls with the emo/punk/goth guys and the e-girl faced creature things.  The games are stomps and boring to really watch and play.  Pro players played in the past 2013-2017 I know some games(40%) would go 40+mins and such but at the least the games FELT like it was being played by pro players. Games had this strategic side of things but now, now I honestly can't tell a difference from Silver games and pro games.

But yeah, not goin' to speak much more on the topic as I'm sure I'll 'offend' people or get a bunch of hate comments/downvotes but that's SOME of the reasons why people/myself don't' watch the LCS as much anymore."
63,"LCS lacks clear leadership. It's like they're winging everything on the spot. On air talent is also is not good. 

Reshuffle needed for next year."
64,Lcs sacrifices good analyst desk for a diverse analyst desk. They're all a chore to listen to because they were picked based on race and nothing more. I'm not surprised nobody wanted to watch it.
65,"I’m not going to tune in to watch a region that can even get out of groups at worlds. Especially now that it’s filled with Koreans and Europeans and we still suck.

I used to watch consistently back with old C9 (2013-2015). All NA boys, fun team.

NA should get combined with LLA. That way we at least get some more talented players in the region."
66,"Have you tried listening to the LCS cast? The production is unbearable, the only saving grace is the doublelift, meteos, sneaky tri-cast"
67,"1.5 years of Corona people got better shit to do during the summer. Also no bjerg or dl, the soul of the lcs is gone

Eta no crowd also does make the viewing experience worse should've tried to get people into the studio for some hype"
68,good news
69,"Jesus, LEC has almost double the average viewers and 2.5x peak viewers. Even random play-off matches beat the LCS final. That's nuts.

https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lec-summer-2021"
70,I can’t watch it anymore unless it’s a co-stream. I hate hearing a sponsors name thrown down my throat every 30 seconds.
71,"Not gonna lie. Multiple factors for me. Double and Bjerg retiring, longer season so regular season doesn’t matter as much. Fun playoffs though"
72,"The game changes probably lost some of the old viewers too. Anecdotally, most of my friends and I stopped playing and thus also lost interest in following LCS."
73,maybe no Bjergsen and no DL hurt a lot ? lot of people are fans of theses two.
74,"for the view of lcs finals , its because its TL and 100T , they don't match TSM and C9 fan base , as a TSM fan i don't look a finals when my team is not here.

&#x200B;

LEC was more interesting"
75,"EU here. I can't watch the LCS for 2 reasons

1. The breaks between games are too long
2. Everything is fucking advertised, just looking at things like ""the ftx gold adv"" are making me sick. Its all bud lite this state farm that where is the game anymore"
76,"imo, the big problem is NA performance is below people expectation and the reminder of a retirement home for international player. The production is full of ads, shoutout and dull. For the analyst desk, I feel like most time they just praise the player and not go deep in analyzing gameplay or criticizing at all"
77,Im not even an EU viewer. The time is fine for me but all of the product placement is irritating. Too much time wasted in between games for boring segments. So I don't even bother
78,First year without Bjerg/Doublelift and covid making the broadcast worse are some reasons why. Doublelift/Bjerg has like 70% of the Twitter followers between them of everyone who competed in spring. Right now casual fans are having a hard time finding new people to cheer for.
79,"I think this mostly has to do with the fact that NA has repeatedly proven itself not to be competitive internationally.  As someone else said, T1 vs DK is on a different level than TL vs 100T.  I really think NA needs 2 ""super teams"" if they're gonna raise viewership.  Give fans a reason to hope internationally."
80,"i watched the final 2 seriess of LCS and it was... yeah.

the weird and incessant sponsor placements just reek of desperation. they don't make for a pleasant viewing experience."
81,"budlight baron, redbull CS, FTX gold, Honda Vision score, Grubhub player of the game, taco bell dragon

like... what are we doing? this league clearly isn't aimed at being winners just a money machine

we the people want winners/winning"
82,it was stupid to increase the number of games played and noone cares about NA cus theres no NA players in it
83,"It's whoever is making the decisions for coverage. They are trying way too fucking hard to be like American pro sports pre-games. I don't think the issue is with the talent but whoever makes the decisions on how they present pre and post-game content. I can't stand watching it.  


Personally, I feel like the LCS has less personality than EU LCS as well. Everything in NA LCS feels homogenous to me."
84,"League is definitely on the decline, at least in NA"
85,Haven't watched regularly since 2015. I stopped watching with the boring lane swap meta in like 2916 then just didnt feel like watching since. Now I only tune in if Faker plays. No players I follow playing anymore.
86,"As a person who dsnt belong to both eu and na , i tell u a simple reason . Eu is exciting to watch , i care about players , g2 fnc matches , team like misfits rouge mad stepping up as new giants its fun . In NA i dont give 2 shits about anyone , its boring the players are just meh , no one has individual personality anymore that attracts and no matter how well they perform in na we know it wont translate into anything big ."
87,If sneaky/meteos/dlift(i dont even like him) didnt costream i wouldnt have watched 1 games of lcs probably.
88,But hey at least your bud light state farm analyst desk is full of diversity
89,"i watched all of playoff games, mostly on costreams.  


either iwd or double.  


man, besides dash who's a monster, most of the talent is really fucking aweful. casters are also good, even tho phreak keeps stiring up stupid shit on twitter and somehow that translates do the way i tolerate his voice. that said, he's good.  


other people are not. not gonna call them out by names, you probably know who i'm talking about, and that's a huge problem."
90,"No TSM, no C9, no surprise"
91,Weird na fans too busy shitting on EU AND Pretending to be LCK FANS to watch LCS I guess
92,Get rid of LS and IWD costreams. Constant shitting on the region and the players are obviously gonna drive the viewers away. They feel no purpose to be watching LCS
93,Now that China has banned kids from playing league it seems like a perfect time to import the top 2000 12 year old+ players to the NA region and get rid of the import limit. Then NA will have some fun games to watch again. Import rule killed NA.
94,"Surely nothing to do with the retirement of DL and Burger King.

NA simply lacks personalities and that's huge when the quality of the league is a clown show"
95,"for me, I stopped watching because Riot stopped balancing the game.  The new champs are just disgustingly unbalanced, so anti fun to play against.  The increase in damage just lowers the skill floor and they have been slowly getting rid of the ability to carry and show skill expression.  Why should I watch the pro scene if Riot doesn't care about the game?"
96,"Personally for me, as an NA resident, it boils down to 3 things.

1. The production quality of the LCS is absolute garbage.
2. The casters are annoying.  They scream about bloody everything instead of only escalating when the game escalates.  Especially Phreak.
3. There is *way* too much downtime."
97,"And I really don’t want to shit on NA because I really love watching the region and love the storylines and orgs, but the gameplay is just a mess. I play in a mid elo team myself and I don’t even understand what some teams macro is. 
On top of that, I don’t really like the way the casters treat the players. I mean I agree with Phreak when he goes on a rampage and points out horrible mistakes that shouldn’t happen, bit imo it makes it hard to watch."
98,"The start time isn't even good for east coast, they're optimized for the west coast even though that isn't a very populated area"
99,"It is the casting for me. They just scream, holler, and fake laugh at each other. I literally cringe when I watch LCS.

For me that is why I don’t watch the LCS.

LEC and LCK all day."
100,"Well, why would you watch a wild card region?"
101,"so to summarize, here's what this subreddit wants out of the LCS:

more promising na-only players ✔️

no imports and/or import rule to be removed or more limiting ✔️

to be competitive internationally with young players and no imports ✔️

viewership equivalent with other major regions filled with veterans ✔️

rookies to not be nervous or underperform internationally ✔️

coaches to not give chances to young players because they made 1 mistake ✔️

certain players to be kicked off teams because this sub doesn't like them ✔️

coaches to be fired because they had bad drafts in a series ✔️

owners who shut the fuck up and do a perfect job ✔️

&#x200B;

so this sub wants the lcs to be full of rookies who are also the best players in the world and consistently dominate internationally while also only being TRUE north american players (sorry oce players, you don't count) and to be entertaining as fuck while they do it, as well, otherwise they'll never be doublelift, sneaky, or bjergsen. they better not underperform either or they will get memed until they have little self-esteem (that definitely won't lead to performance issues). and if the coaches don't put the hard carry 1v9 player on irelia every game? r/byebyejob :) the players better not speak up for themselves or ever show signs of being upset or have fun being dardoch 2.0! can't forget about the owners who should submit to every whim of the populace of this sub otherwise they're dogshit and have no clue how to run a business and don't deserve those super talented  17 year old 1v9, worlds-dominating savants. sounds feasible..."
102,ITT: EU LEC elitists mald about the start time of a league not intended for them and make false comparisons about the broadcast.
103,"According to this sub this place is NA biased and more NA fans, at least that’s what the EU fans tell us

If that’s the case shouldnt we expect NA viewership to hold? What’s going on here? Even if Reddit isn’t everything it should be a massive part.. 

Really doesn’t feel like this sub is NA favoured, especially when half the comments are about scheduling for EU viewers lol"
104,Shooketh.
105,"Everything sucks from the change in schedule, long breaks analyst desk, awful repetitive games it's like every game is the same - do nothing, wait for elder,  and one teamfight or throws and the game is over. 

You don't really see hero plays anymore in the lcs. Only a handful of players are looking to make intelligent plays, the rest are risk averse and playing to not look bad so they don't get flamed and replaced, in the end everyone just farms."
106,That makes sense. It starts too late for me now whereas in the past it was a natural transition from Eu to NA stream. I also don't really like the show nowadays as much as I did in the past.
107,"LCS has a lot of personalities. But they don't do anything with them. We don't get good Trashtalk, we don't get any good Stories. Its just bland.

NA stopped caring about EU viewers. With their Bud Light Sponsor they killed for example the German Broadcast. Games are also late af. EU people also don't really like all these Sponsors. At least not called out at any event. Seems a bit much. They squeeze out everything to get a brand name in it. ""Honda performance play.. roccat whatever"" no thanks.

People see it as a meme league. Old Players go there to retire. And its not far off seeing how many bad players are still in the lcs (or have been for a long time). Then the Top Teams go to Worlds and get shit on. ""We will do better next year"". Yeah for sure.

Analyst desk feels like a talkshow without any fun. MarkZ looks boring most of the time which is the best part about it."
108,"I couldn't care less about international success, but I wish I could watch the games without having to ruin my sleep schedule."
109,"Not surprising when the two most popular lcs players ever retired in the offseason along with the terrible schedule, boring broadcast, all carried by a few casters and riot Dash"
110,"They added costreaming to try and boost viewers but even that didn't work. Costreaming has a huge downside in that a portion of the viewers get used to watching LCS without watching the broadcast, instead they're listening to their favourites cast the league and usually shitting on it while doing so. Costreams are much lighter than the broadcast itself so they attract viewers easily however once viewers are used to costreams they won't go back to watching the broadcast and they will riot if LCS bans costreaming again. I think costreaming not increasing overall viewer count spells the end of the LCS as we know it, once people begin to quit costreaming (they are moving on with their lives/LCS too irrelevant to costream) viewership is going to tank and there's nothing LCS can do about it now. They never needed to win internationally or anything to fix their problems, they just needed to improve the broadcast which they haven't been able to do."
111,But that sweep in the finals was pretty awesome
112,The current meta for champions and items in incredibly uninteresting. When they dump the item rework I'll consider watching again.
113,First thing I think about when I think about NA are the observers...
114,"Start times are awful even for NA players especially east coast. It’s too late and too far after lec even if lec goes 5 long games NA still starts too late. They can’t expect people to eat their entire weekends to watch lcs. 

International success is basically non existent and the old personalities of doublelift sneaky and bjerg are gone. 

Production is absolutely horrific. I can’t even explain how bad production is for lcs and to me is the main reason apart from starting times that lcs is just garbage. I feel cringe and weird watching lcs production I mean they literally put on a mental health evaluation before an incredible playoff match I couldn’t stand to watch it. Who wants to feel like that and watch that trash before playoffs? Half the people the bring on don’t even play league and I have no clue who they are. Why would I ever watch this absolute trash over lec lck and LPL I have so much fun watching those leagues the production is fun and humorous. Than after lcs awful production you get to watch some of the worst league in the world lol. Can’t have the worst production and the worst league play in the world who would want to watch that? Analysis desk is also absolutely awful outside of dash. Wow it’s bad."
115,"Just curious

This viewcount counts costreams right? 

Because I think that might have something to do with it to

I was watching the IWD costream with Febiven and Guilhoto all weekend 

I'm sure many were watching other co streams too"
116,"Feel like a lot of it has to do with the fact that LCS is so stale, not only from a production side of things but also because there just aren't any teams for some of us to root for anymore.

In my discord, me and my 6 friends who i've known since 2014, none of us really have a team we like, outside of a couple of them who like TSM and are quite faithful.

I personally miss C9 when it was the good old days. Now I just cannot really root for them.

Internationally we always suck. Why root for a loser when they seem to lose more and more each year when the big games come around?

Almost feel like 100T, TL and C9 aren't going to do anything at worlds this year. My only hope is for TL to get their heads together and put the LCS Finals behind them after that ugly showing. I think they have the greatest potential to win."
117,For me the games start too late and tbh the quality of the games are low plus what is with the massive amount of time between games to have people chat and be bombarded with ads :/
118,NA could win worlds and you'd still have poor viewership if the games start at 1 am
119,In game and analyst desk sponsor/ads are straight cancer. The companies think they’re cheeky getting their ads into the games but in reality they’re just begging me to stop using their products. Also the casting in LEC is simply on another level.
120,No offense but cut all these trash casters and analysts. Then cut out the breaks and add more engaging content. Next level with meteos is cool but the other content is snooze worthy.
121,"We're the region that good players go to retire. Already AFTER their peak of course, but while they're still expensive. 

Coaches and Owners with tons of money thrown around but no fucking idea how to make a competitive team. LCS is more likely to be a money laundering scheme than a legitimate competitive league.

Also, we don't have enough good players to support 10 teams. LCS should be shrunk to 8 teams. Never should have been 10 in the first place."
122,I didn't even know who was playing so I didn't care to watch it
123,"Gee I wonder why, that segment about mental health etc with akaadian before the C9 vs TSM match to determine the last worlds spot is what they choose to show the audience. 

The segment was nice, but why right before the hypest match? It’s just oddball decision after oddball decision with the content 

The differences in quality between lcs and lec is so contrasting it’s ridiculous.

Not to mention the quality of games in playoffs, LEC was absolute bonkers, where as NA was incredibly disappointing in quality and in champion select. I swear people don’t enjoy seeing the same 15-20 champions picked and banned every game. The game needs fundamental champion buffs to the point where what’s meta isn’t just 2-3 picks only."
124,"Maybe its because bo1 suck???
Change my mind."
125,"Kaizen. Sorry, dude"
126,"As a north american casual, I only watch lcs for perkz, no perkz no interest. Other issue is level of gameplay is just… sad. Its only thing if NA is bad and produces entertaining fiestas, but NA teams play so slow, have poor dive co ordinations and in general handshake a lot of games (read more like dont know what theyre supposed to be doing at each stage in the game). Its just a less entertaining region than LEC, where you have fnatic/mad/vitality who are always willing to coinflip as well as teams like rogue who can co ordinate good early aggression. Just my 2c"
127,"Does this take into account the viewers Doublelift, Sneaky and Meteos's co-stream was taking off the official broadcast?"
128,Does this account for co streams? They regularly account for like 50k viewers
129,"Start earlier. Get better analyst desk. Don’t have a 30 minute break in between games. Even if game quality is ass, viewers will go up 50K"
130,"It's hard to watch the LCS anymore. The production used to be the best part they used to do actual analysis and game prep now they don't even have a pre-show, it's just next level which is fine but tbh I don't care about next level when matches are happening I want that on off days. After matches they barely go over the game it's like 2 minutes then 3 minute break 2 minutes leading into next game another 3 minute break. I also wish the analyst was you know full of analysts at most it feels like only Emily or Raz are the only ones analyzing the games. Makes me really miss Jatt, dude was a beast at giving actual relevant and interesting stats. He would have actual segments on the game. I just don't get why they shifted away from content before and after games. The only thing LCS has left is casters and the top teir host Dash."
131,"This was the first year since 2014 i was invested in LCS but that is solely because of closer so i'm extremely biased, but overall the quality is definitely better than the peak of lcs viewership. I dont think it's about broadcast quality as some argue, i would just tell them to go watch 2014-2015 finals and see how amateur the whole thing was. Its probably because of lack of international success and people not giving a shit beyond their retired favorite players."
132,"All my favorite players stopped playing or were unable to find teams (and even my favorite teams screwed over their own players to chase the idea of a skilled roster... often failing to meet the reality), just don't see much of a reason to tune in regularly anymore. I don't have any players I feel overly strongly about or any teams I really want to cheer for. It's too corporate now, there's no personality to invest in."
133,The LCS has made this choice. They picked this specific time for the games for their sponsors that are all trying to target Americans. They don’t care about the extra views if it’s not targeting this audience. The view count went down so much because it’s such a bad time for anywhere else
134,"I only watch LCS to support EU talents. Other than that, I don't have reason in watching them. I find the analyst desk of LCS a bit boring to me. I don't hate the personalities it's just that their delivery is not my cup of tea."
135,Personally all the players I care about watching have retired.
136,It really needs an overhaul...they are in LA that shouldn't be hard to do and maybe take some advice from the LEC
137,"I haven’t watched live in legit years, always just catch the highlights and vods over at the LOLeventvods subreddit"
138,"I'm not convinced this is a problem. A lot of the stalwart teams struggled and there are new teams showing up on the scene, and those teams haven't had chances and opportunities to build fanbases yet, but big victories and successful seasons will help change that."
139,"thats because they dont know how to keep the streams inclusive and undivided.

They have features where you get loot for watching it on the LoL Esports site and then they have people that love to gamble watching it on twitch using channel points betting on the winning/losing teams.

Another thing that could potentially help is adding schedules for the LCS in the panels below the stream. Instead they make users click on a banner navigating them to another site. Yes, 1 click isn't hard but it's the same concept as clicking on an AD and thus turning people away by clicking the X in the top right corner instead.

Then again, I could be wrong as this is only assumption on my part."
140,People are ready for worlds and NA teams do nothing but disappoint in big events for the most part. We all know that the winner is likely going to get bent over by a team in Asia so might as well not watch until Worlds
141,One factor is that LCS starts to late Europeans don't have time to eyeball it. LEC is better scheduled to attract NA viewers than LCS is for EU viewers.
142,"For me, as a European, there are 3 main reasons I don't watch LEC.


1. Timeslots, personally I don't care that the games start late because I have the luxury to stay up late (tho I think this is the main reason Europeans don't watch LEC). For me the problem is that games start after LEC, watching 5 LEC games takes a long time but then also watching 5 more LCS games + downtime isn't fun at all anymore. On some days that would be 12 hours of watching league, it's bearly doable but it's definitely not fun.


2. Broadcast, I don't think the casters are bad but they haven't found a good balance between fun and serious in the LCS. It feels like the LEC team is so much more cohesive and have a much clearer picture of how they want the broadcast to be perceived. LEC is not only a fun competition to watch but also a fun and informative broadcast.


3: Format, the are almost 0 stakes during regular season. Especially now that wins in Spring carry over. Games are boring because you know it barely matters at all if your favorite team wins or not. They should really make regular season feel more impactful to bring some excitement to the matches."
143,"They absolutely cannot go into 2022 with the same broadcast team.  Outside of the casters, and Dash, the entire broadcast team is putrid.  They need to find new talent to replace basically the entire analyst desk.  They need to work on their transitions into the next game.  Their pre-game content is absolutely terrible but likely has a lot to do with the talent being bad.  

Fix the broadcast and the viewership will go up a lot.  I found myself turning it off a lot and then forgetting and just watching the VODs on Youtube later."
144,"Dumb question, but do these viewership numbers include watching co-streams? I have completely switched from watching the main broadcast to watching co-streams and I'm not the only one. There is still interest in LCS... but it's just not in the main broadcast imo"
145,FTX GOLD LEAD
146,Didn’t help that it was a 3-0 stomp
147,"LCS needs to restructure their broadcast. We have a million ""short breaks"" in between a series and nobody wants to sit through that. Also, with the time slot, If you're putting a game up at 5:00pm EST, you're expecting Europe League fans to be up at like 11:00pm to watch a games for a region they aren't entirely invested in. Unless it's TSM/C9, viewership is going not be that great. Nobody in EU wants to stay up at 1am to watch CLG/Flyquest throw leads for 45 minutes. I understand it's easier for NA fans to watch LEC, it starts around noon for those on US east coast. Also, the LEC production team gives us a reason to be excited for the games. They hype it up incredibly. Even if it was a game between S04/SK, they still hyped it like it was FNC/G2 or RGE/MAD. LCS production is good at memeing and giving us cutting edge statistics such as [THIS.](https://imgur.com/a/RJtGBVI) Outside of Kobe, Flowers, and Disappointed Dad Phreak, I don't really feel genuinely hyped to watch. Most of the time I feel Masterminds and Lane X Lane are the only enjoyable pieces of content."
148,"As an EU viewer, a combination of poor time scheduling and lack of ""household"" names like doublelift and bjergsen has made me lose interest in LCS

I used to watch LCS purely for the DL story with him filling up his trophy collection, but now that he is retired and there are many newer players, it feels like too much of a commitment to watch and get to know newer players"
149,"I could see it bumping up some after the finals.  I didn’t care about anyone in the LCS this year but I do now.  I would call myself a 100T fan, I like their players a lot, love seeing huhi succeed.

One thing though I always watch VODs.  I do not care at all about the discussions that happen between matches."
150,"markz, crumbz, primal, hai, frosk are ruinning the watching experience, this is so baaaad to watch most of the time i cant stand between games analysis or post game interviews"
151,"Don't play anymore.. still watch a bit, but without playing it doesn't suck me in as much watching either"
152,Maybe the weather was too good in Europe and everybody had fun outside! Oh wait...
153,"all the big players that people followed are gone. all these new players are OCE and LEC and LCK imports and honestly i just dont get excited seeing any of their names. 

also years of international failure doesnt help either lol, every time you watch a play in LCS and the casters are like OMG WHAT A PLAY, theres a little voice in the back of your mind going, yeah nice play, still gonna get demolished at worlds tho.

also the ridiculous branding on EVERYTHING is really rturning me off. why do i need to hear state farm, ftx shitcoin, etc every 2 minutes???"
154,"As someone who hasn't played the game in bout 4 years now, I still used to pop in for pro games but lately it feels like the wait between games is so fucking long filled with drawn out nonsense analyzing the previous games intercut with commercials... it gets old real fast"
155,It feels like LEC desk has a nice balance of memes from Twitch Chat and analysis sections. I used to think the skit sections with Markz and Crumbz were funny (I know Twitch chat spams cringe but I think that's just an extension of NA bad meme). I really liked when Jatt was on the desk too and it felt more like 5 bros shooting the shit. LEC players feel more genuine on the desk or in interview settings too. Not sure if that's a sponsor thing and LCS is trying to be more clean cut but it's noticeable.
156,"LCS has no charismatic host. Tigress for Ovilee? Seriously? No wonder no one watches anymore. I don’t even know who the primal guy is but he does not know the game. And Emily rand is really meekish, not great for an on air cast. There’s just too many people now bombarding people with their breakdown stuff. And It’s clear people don’t enjoy being bombarded with breakdowns from 10 different people especially when so many games are super dry. Just give Ovilee the checks they’re paying primal Emily and tigress at this point and have her do her dumb anime dances  and interviews. The LCS has never been more stale. Need a new high energy host, get crumbs to do his prophet skits, raz to do his wacky stuff, idk. But this shit we have right now is atrocious."
157,Too late for EU viewers.
158,"It's not really fun to watch a league so littered with ads, with boring analysts that bring nothing unique or exclusive to them, on really bad timeslots for EU (i am basically forced to stop watching from game 3 onwards if i want to function at all the next day).

I hoped the rebrand and new format would make things better, but it only made summer split more boring and less intense. Add to that 8/10 teams vying for a playoffs spot, players I barely recognise aside from the top teams, teams that all basically have the same brand and fan interaction (FlyQuest had a good thing going but suddenly everything is Spanish because Josedeodo),...

Content outside of the broadcast is also bland. You have the dive and next level (which is just The Dive with Meteos) and then this weird Masterminds series, which has a fun concept and is the only thing that looks interesting enough to watch, but has too much talking and not enough visual support to keep me hooked.

I was talking about how boring LCS got with friends and the biggest issue theu had was sponsors being mentioned waaay too much during games to the point where you couldnt look away from them. A phrase we use a lot when watching is ""FTX Gold Advantage, because NA can't do math"". Seriously, what an idea to give the GOLD DIFFERENCE a sponsor??? At least try something interesting, like the LEC has with SAP! We were laughing our asses off when we saw the first Divine Sunderer completed a full minute ahead of the prev record during FNC vs MAD! Those are things you don't know or see in a regular game. FTX gold advantage just makes it seem like only first graders watch LCS.

NA really has to come up with fresh content inside and outside of the broadcasts. Their level of gameplay won't carry them and LEC is miles ahead and still going stronger every year.

Prayge"
159,If average viewership goes down but you have more games than your views will still be up
160,"It's slowly becoming woke, more about feelings and less about championships.   Ppl want to see champions and competition."
161,"Personally, I stopped watching when the old guard retired."
162,How come no one mentions DL costream consistently gets 20-30k views? LS costream is also there. With those in mind is the average/peak still low?
163,"It’ll only get worse if NA gets slapped at worlds again. 

The format was also boring. Riot needs to praise EG and GG for making the last several weeks of regular season interesting. Even then the suspense was superficial, who actually cares if GG get the last stop in playoffs over fly, they are equally likely to get knocked out without much of a fight in a BO5 and sure EG were fun to watch but what were they playing for, they were never at risk of dropping to lower bracket."
164,But I was flamed and downvoted in a previous thread for saying that NA viewership was piss poor throughout the season once again and that the only reason there was this many viewers to begin with in the Finals was EU viewers joining the LCS stream after LEC finals. I can probably count on my hands the amount of weeks in Summer and Spring 2021 where NA viewership crossed 100K. The interest in pro League of legends is declining at a rapid rate in NA and I’m not convinced it can be fixed. I’m not even sure why sponsors keep funnelling money to LCS teams.
165,Anyone have viewer number from other regions? I really curious how many people in China watch lpl. Or Japan lol is it how big there? This got me so curious suddenly or if any kind heart could point me towards the correct site.
166,"it think it might be interesting to look at the number of co-stream views and factor that into the totals. i know that personally, the only lcs i watched this year was on dom or ls’s co-streams."
167,I miss Ovilee sm.. she was so passionate n caring
168,Good. Keep it that way or lower until they improbe the level of play. My body is ready for NA's annual Worlds stomping
169,"Breaking news: shit company puts out shit product, fans react accordingly"
170,"I gotta say, I look through the list of players and I just don't have a single face I can put to like 90% of them. Who are they? What are they like?

Old NA pros were personalities. You cared about them because they were fun to watch. Modern NA pros are highly sanitized for optimum business. Stick around for 1 split then disappear back into academy forever. Who were they? Were they even real people?

And of course there's the fact that there ARE no real NA pros. 100% of the winning team are imports (ok, Huhi isn't *really* an import, but it makes for a good narrative).  Like, what interesting NA pros are there right now? Damonte, Blabber, Spica...Afromoo? I can't really think of any others"
171,"I'll admit I did t watch. 

And to be honest, I haven't been watching Cloud9 games either. 


I'm just waiting for Worlds because LCS doesn't interest me in the slightest bit except for worlds Qual."
172,"It's been beaten to death, but the break between games really kills it. Also the Bo1 format just doesn't make me care about the regular season. I watched almost all of the playoff matches, but outside of the two CLG games I could force myself to watch, I don't think I watched any regular season."
173,"Big names retired, interesting story teams were out of running fairly early, the skill gap between lcs and other major regions is huge atm and the summer final was a easy series. Lead to a lot of reason for low viewership"
174,"The whole format could use a shake-up, I think. Let’s experiment, at least. 

Obviously the time between games in a match is far too long. It feels longer than halftime at a football game (either NA football or soccer football). 

Maybe they could try the live, in-game 6th man coach. 
Allow mirror matches (Zed v Zed mid, e.g.). 
My favorite idea is to have champs be single-use during a match - if Zoe is picked or banned in game 1, she can’t be used again the whole match…it would really stretch champion pools and strategies."
175,Well who wanna watch NA 🤷🏼‍♂️ without C9/TSM even less relevant
176,"I'll be honest, I don't watch LCS because the team's lack identity and the league lacks narrative.

To compare to LEC - you have Fnatic and Vitality, these hyper aggressive teams whose main weakness is themselves, vitality literally pulled a 5 man tower dive in their last game to qualify for playoffs. Rogue who play completely by the book and choke out teams that can't find windows. MAD, who teamfight so well they can win in massive deficits while laughing about it. G2, no description needed, star studded roster. 

Most teams have at least some personality to the way they play. Even the lower teams had some kind of thing going for them, be it Markoon for XL or BrokenBlade for S04.

In LCS I see this much less. It feels more like a selection of stacked rosters with very little personality or true rivalry. I don't even know if this is because the team's lack their own style or because it's just not spoken about so much, but the broadcast team need to find some more interesting ways to present their teams or they'll continue failing to get viewers beyond the first weeks of people wanting to see how the newest import performs."
177,im shocked (not)  poor lead-in being so long after LEC and a 3-0 stomp
178,The games are snoozefests and the broadcast is soooooo bad (in-game casting not withstanding). I've been a dedicated viewer since season 4 and I barely tuned in this year
179,Can't add to much more from what everyone else has already said. Everything between games is either low quality content or ads. Ingame is the constant shill of companies along with the observer literally being an AI that still needs work. I watch very very few games live. Majority of the games I watch are highlights but will still watch some matchups all the way through. LEC though has been killing it and when I do have time to tune in i'll watch it all even the inbetween content.
180,At it’s core Na lcs is boring. Boring and bad “narratives” created by the casters and way too much wasted time. Sure the games can still be fun to watch but to watch anything else live besides gameplay is horrendously drab
181,"It's like watching regular sports now, full of disgusting ads and people that are only playing to get far too much money. On top of that it's the bottom teams in the world fighting for a spot to embarrass themselves against top teams at worlds."
182,"the gameplay itself is why I stopped watching. Na is a snooze fest. Why would I watch that when I can watch LPL which holds my attention from the start of the game to the end more often than not.

In LPL I find myself rewatching teamfights 2-3 times because they are so crazy while in NA a team will get 4 man wombo comboed with their flashes all up"
183,The fucking observer sucks. I have to watch post game highlights to even see what happen during key moments for half the games. If I wanted to just watch people farm I'd play the game myself
184,"Another big reason is that it was a team that doesn’t have some massive following. If this was a TSM vs C9 final there would be double the viewership, I’d wager"
185,"LCK, LPL has better mechanics & legend. LEC has content and production."
186,"Not sure if this is a common thing, but I went from watching quite a bit of Lcs to just watching costream uploads this year. Much more entertaining with personalities like Dl, Meteos, and Sneaky + plus it just highlight reels the games anyway. Until Na put up a decent performance at worlds again the regions going to lose interest. At least league isn't dying and these viewers are just going to other regions though, like Lec and Lpl."
187,Can you think of who the most popular LCS player is atm?
188,I stopped watching because the production is just so trash. The observing just makes serves to annoy me and the scheduling is never on time.
189,"The games were on so late in the day for the east coast… add that it was a prolonged season and there wasn’t a compelling need to watch every game since they’re not limited. 
 
Why does baseball have more viewers throughout the year yet can’t come close to touching single day viewership by the NFL?
 
NA starts too late and I’m in NA. The west coast is the only market they focus on.
 
The amount of ad breaks too was insane… like I thought the break timers always existed as a buffer for the games that go longer than others, not solely as a window to guarantee advertisements. I’d flip to something else and forget to go back or by the time I switched back it was another ad break."
190,"""Oh right, this still exists"" -me everytime I hear something about lcs. feel bad for saying it but me and friends kinda keep just forgetting about it."
191,"Yeah I stopped watching this season, the teams are boring and the content sucks."
192,I'm sure back in the days people wanted to watch lcs before even myself. However it starts at midnight where I live and I don't want to wake up the next day feeling like trash watching LEC's academy championship.
193,Why watch LCS with analysis desk when I can get similar quality of play on SaltyTeemo.
194,"Think a lot of the downswing is sheer amount of downtime on the stream combined with poor performance/low quality games and analysis. 

It’s probably the rose tinted glasses but in my mind the past a Bo5 had game, straight to analysts, which would last until champ select started up again 10 minutes later. Now it’s game, 3 minute break, analysts, 3 minute break, interview, 3 minute break, champ select. The actual time between games may not be different, but now it’s just dead space instead of content. 

Add to that the content itself is worse as well, and why would I stay tuned in for 6 hours? To hear Letigress say “let’s kick it to a break” 10 times an hour, or suffer through hearing Hai talk? Maybe to see which team throws harder than the others? 

Better things to do"
195,"NA is just poor in all aspects.

There is little to no entertainment. The casters over-hype stuff. The commercials and your budlight Baron are just too much. 

The coaching is just plain wrong, toxic and lazy. Local talents are not properly developed. 

The server has higher latency which is awful for players. 

The players are just not ethical enough and the region is viewed as an retirement league. But this maybe also is a consequence of not developing talents.

Personally I watch LPL, LCK, LEC and all of those leagues has it own beauty. Some are bloody mechanical, other is bloody macro and strategy focused etc.
Once I watched LPL, I couldn't not go and watch LCS again. It is just below any standards."
196,"This is sad. What's even sadder is that this sub seems to love that this is occurring, it's kind of strange lol. I wouldn't think that the hate for NA would overshadow the love for the game, but here we are."
197,"Expected when there's almost no native talent, the same happened in SC2"
198,"I don’t know if it’s a valid contributor but I wonder if having an older audience just reduces the ability to watch as religiously.

I tend to catch up on the matches I care later on youtube the next morning or throughout the work week.  I’d love to have been able to tune into the finals but I just had too many things going on."
199,"EU has better production, plain and simple."
200,"Not trying to start shit here but 100t, TL, c9, tsm are fun to watch but the other teams are just so boring. As someone else mentioned I have no interest in watching immortals vs gg or dig vs clg."
201,maybe if they actually had some fucking Americans id be more inclined to watch
202,"Actually kind of shocking since I don't think ESC was including co-stream numbers at the beginning, but now seems like they have. Even with that, LCS is at a major loss, that's pretty nuts."
203,"Game is boring

Hopefully this patch shakes up the meta"
204,"As someone who previously watched LCS religiously since season 5 this season was the least I've watched.

My reasons:

1. Garbage international performances for a million years in a row has sucked out all hope I had in our teams so I don't have the will to support them anymore.

2. All the ""big name"" and big personality players with big streams are all gone. Bjerg, sneaky, doublelift, meteos, etc. So those ""after LCS"" late streams where everyone comes together into the pros chat and hears what they have to say is gone, it feels disconnected with all the current players.

3. The game is just not as good anymore from the marksmen Point-of-view. Tank utility ashe, Varus sitting 10 screens away trying to not interact and shooting arrows. As an ADC main - league was the best when ADC was the role that determined mid/late game teamfights with huge crits and mechanics and being the star role. Nowadays every other role is more important than the marksmen.


At the end of the day though, if our teams actually competed internationally we'd be watching, but watching these teams do the same exact 0-10 bullshit every year at worlds just kills any interest to support them."
205,"The ads and stuff like ""FtX GoLD DiffeIrReNcE!"" doesnt help either. There is a reason why we left the traditional tv (That has ads every 5min which is also 5min long XD) behind embraced the streaming content(Netflix). Now they are slipping more and more ads (ReD BuLl BaRoN play!) into the lcs games. This might not be too bad for NA as I heard you guys are used to it. But its certainly not a common thing for eu."
206,Sneaky doublelift and meteos took a lot of those views. Double lifts YouTube vid already has about 100k. Idk if they are counting that
207,"There’s a lot of things I like about LCS and I’ve watched for about a year and a half now. But I must say, I’m a bit glad in a way their numbers are falling for all the blasphemous things going on with the league. But I’m sure they don’t care, unless their sponsors do."
208,For me it's the fact that the broadcasting team takes way to long between games and it's just boring as hell.  Also the sponsors make things weird. Really weird.
209,"Starting at midnight was a huge kick in the teeth for anybody from EU that wants to watch but the complete selling out and obnoxious advertising was the final nail for me. The Bud Light Ace, Red Bull Baron, FTX Gold, Grub Hub food box, Statefarm Desk, Coca Cola vision score, Hershey chocolate CS difference, etc"
210,"Problem is that it starts to late for European people, the end."
211,"Desk long production bad bjerg dl snacky gone na = poverty region eu funner to watch 
Plain n simple"
212,"I really think the lcs would be well served by cutting the number of teams in the league. If you had say 6 teams only than every matchup would be watchable at least. Internationally who cares since at most 3 go to worlds.

It might even increase competition.

What really are ggs, flyquest, dig, IMO, and I hate to say it but clg really bringing to the league?"
213,I didn't like the analysts doing draft analysis. Too many voices.
214,a lot of viewership left after game 2.it was a shitshow of a stomp.no point in watching game 3.qe where in a watch party with friends and family and we all left. and so did a lot of ppl.numbers didn't lie.it was probably the most boring finals I've ever watched .100t made Tl look like an amateur team
215,"Players with no charisma or state presence. Who the fuck cares about fakegod they guy can't even articulate in an interview.
No personalities to care for and a horrible skill level"
216,Change your production team and MOST of your fucking analysts lol.
217,[deleted]
218,Why the hell would I opt into a product full of adverts as its primary selling point?
219,"people are saying its too many games (travis gafford) , not enough competition, fiesta games where anyone can beat anyone, etc. But is it really that big of a surprise of dip in viewership after 2 of the most popular players (bjerg, DL ) retire? those 2 alone had/have massive fan bases who are extremely loyal and also like me, old timers.

We are entering a new era of fans, viewership, and individual talent/popularity. Only time will tell how viewership will continue moving forward but if they think cutting games is going to solve viewership, they are very very wrong."
220,"I'm blaming this on long time between games, games not starting when they say and too much filler desk commentary"
221,who tf likes to see minor league gameplay olus the fact that the both times in the final only one is rlly big
222,I kinda think if NA has less slots for worlds then the league would be more meaningful to win and generate more hype. I felt like after the top 3 were decided the hype died down a little. That or go back to the gauntlet for the other spots xus that was far more exciting then a double Elim playoffs with 8 teams
223,"It's easy to see why as well, there's shit loads of under performing imports who are there to cash in on their careers, a general lack of native players for the fans to get behind, no more fun or intense rivalries, and the level of play in general compared to other regions is a bad as it's ever been comparatively.

Not to mention that pretty much all of the iconic OG players are now retired and have not been replaced by the new blood that people are truly excited for compared to EU for example where we too have lost a lot of our OG fan favorites but they have since been replaced by exciting rookies who are the peak faces of the LEC. NA needs to put together some good native rosters, have a run of strong performances internationally to get people back invested and hope that from that they can get some exciting story lines and rivalries develop naturally between the players and the orgs. Hell even their broadcast team which used to be the absolute pinnacle of quality in terms of casting and production seems pretty mediocre nowadays where as EU who used to have an atrocious production team are flying high since we split from the LCS and formed under the LEC banner."
224,"For me personally, i just didnt care...
The record from spring carrying over sounded great in theory but it didnt matter at all.
TSM won regular season, bombed against TL and chocked against C9 and gg no worlds.
So who gives a fuck about Summer when it all comes down to playoffs?
Esp with the bracket format it all felt so weird to begin with, yeah its great 100T won the whole thing but getting a Worlds slot after only beating EG in a bo5 was very weird.
And same with the finals. After world slots being devided already the finals felt like an afterthought rather then a must win.

Games have to matter, and while trying to make Spring have an impact we ended up with both splits meaning fuck all since 8/10 teams would qualify for playoffs anyway.
As an avid EU viewer for years i never felt this lack of motivation to stay away for a game.
And yeah, timezones should be looked at.
Starting a game at 03:00AM CET means cutting out a fuckton of your viewers, even if its in the weekend."
225,"I found that this was the split I watched the least of, only really regularly tuning in towards playoffs."
226,"I didn't watch a single LCS game all season, for the first time ever.  Still watch LCK regularly and LEC occasionally, but with DoubleLift and Sneaky both retired, it feels like there's no one to follow."
227,Production is awful!! Flowers kobe azael are fantastic and everyone else is dumber than rocks
228,Part of that has to be the fan bases of each team. They're much smaller than for TSM or C9 and their individual player fan bases aren't too much to write home about either.
229,"Because I literally don't care about any stories in the LCS. The players are worse, and the best players don't play some of the time (Alphari, Zven). Not to mention the most exciting player to ever come to the league wasn't even top 3 in his role.

Why would I watch? None of the players are interesting outside of the rift, and the top players are less appealing this split than in previous ones."
230,"It's decreasing because the old guard is gone and the people who make up the viewership of the past 10 yrs are grownups now with responsibilities. League isn't a serious viewer sport that has staying power across generations, it's not that kind of product. The LEC might be ok now, but it's inevitable. Look at Korea when faker is gone. League of legends had and has viewership because of the original pro player personalities and the audience that grew up with it. Once they are gone, it's over. Riot, time to make a new game and/or cultivate a new set of players and audience."
231,"1. Too many shitty teams and games. They need to axe 2 if not 4 teams. NA doesn't have enough talent to field 6+ teams.

2. Awful music in between skits

3. Awful music during the skits

4. Terrible skits

5. Bringing on Frosk

Why would anyone watch this shit?"
232,"i mean... DL and Bjerg gone, plus TL and C9 sandbagging with subs for decent amount of time. not exactly a surprise imho"
233,"I think there are three big factors that led to this:

 1) Whoever was running spectator mode this season has been fucking awful

2) Bjerg and Doublelift retiring def hurts

3) As the viewer base gets older they have less time, every year the LCS matches now I have a full-time and a part-time job which doesn't leave me much time to watch what I want to watch."
234,"Poor hours for EU peeps + loosing 2 superstars + everybody is a fucking import from EU + being overall dogshit and most important

**a stupid format that nobody understands with teams starting ""summer"" with spring record and no hype at all.**

LCS is set to be the biggest failure after OWL. This whole shit needs to revamp. I was told by reddit that NA fans dont care about imports and that the majority of the fanbase is NA so the hours dont matter in the beginning of spring... Now the numbers are worse than when there was relegation...., There is still the same 4 teams with some attention and they are still completely dogshit internationally while not having almost any native players.  


EDIT: the format and people on analyst desk are also a fucking joke. nobody knows them, the talent is literally making people switch from the OG broadcast to LS/Sneaky/DL and they get paid for that...."
235,There is no fun without TSM
236,"After LCS team owners attempted to lift the import rule, I've had less interest in watching LCS games. They're not here to improve the region or develop talent; they are only in it for themselves, which is not a bad thing if they didn't try to hide behind more ""noble"" intents. If you're trying to win and make money, just fucking say it. Don't bullshit with a bullshit PR response. ""Developing NA talent"" was not in their books until they received backlash for their bullshit."
237,It was fun at first. Then it became predictable. Lane lane lane and then team fight for objective and game over.
238,"a lot of cringy venting in this thread about people upset life isn't how it was when they were younger, and trying to frame it as a league problem"
239,the league suffers a lot from not having personalities like DL to carry a lot of the interest. the teams also mattered more back then... now they just all swap players/imports around and don't have any identity other than being vc funded
240,Does anyone know if this includes co streams?
241,It's a dead region like EU.
242,"I think we need to take into consideration that this is Esports charts reporting of data, not the official source data. 

Esports charts is about 20-30% lower than the sum of the official streams on Twitch and YouTube plus the co-streamers. You could argue that they are removing people watching multiple streams at the same time, but they seem to think it's a significant portion of the audience.

This probably sounds like copium or whatever, but I've noticed in Valorant too that esports charts doesn't know how to handle co-streaming and undercalls the number of people watching."
243,The finals viewership is misleading. It doesn’t include viewer numbers from non league streamers who still costreamed the finals like Valkyrae
244,"Maybe the numbers are negligible, but I’m not seeing anybody talk about the Twitch co-streams which I almost watch exclusively now unless I’m going back to find a vod on YouTube. Watched LCS since season 3 but the production is just uninteresting now compared to the perspective, though sometimes silly, of DL, Sneaky, Meteos, etc."
245,There's a reason I only watch the costream...
246,"Danny and Fudge are a huge bright spot for NA pro play. The game took out a lot of its macro elements and added a lot of power.   


On the caster side when I lived in Asia people watched the LCS because the casters were fun and got you excited. The analyst desk was great as well. You had personalities like doublelift who wasn't afraid to talk trash. Solo and Fudge are the two that will now but don't have that name status like DL. You were so invested in the players, analysts, and casters before."
247,"Hopefully this year NA will finally deliver at Worlds again. Genuinely hyped to see what 100T can do.

Rooting from EU."
248,"I know it's not looking great BUT i will say that NA stepped up production A LOT and the teams/games got a whole lot more interesting to watch.
Change and progress takes time and NA really messed it up earlier, but i am hopeful that the changes done this year will help the NA scene rebuild it's value to the viewers.
But considering that majority of the ""good"" stuff happened in summer i don't think they are harvesting the fruit of their work just yet. Also Worlds performance will of course affect this a lot."
249,"As a EU watcher who mainly watched NA my biggest reason to stop watch NA is the side content:

Personally I found that NA always had the better content and with more quality. Eyes on, Dous, the much much better hype trailer for playoffs and season start but they never improved on that and rather stayed the same. Even worse they always have this super serious tone coupeld with high prodution quality, it´s like the same blueprint over and over. They simply can´t do something else.   
This or that was so fresh and funny but after 3 years of watching it kinda becomes stale.    
Eu on the other hand have with the popquiz, flexius etc. much more lighter content I can enjoy without taking 30 min for it.   


NA was never for me the power house region, rather it was the All star region where all the proven talent of the world could brawl it out.   
Without the merch company I would have lost any interest in the region."
250,We like guns here in NA.
251,Living in USA 🇺🇸 we only have time for work and sleep ! Woo
252,"Are we gonna act like we don’t know the reason why?

It’s because DL, Sneaky and Meteos co-streaming the LCS."
253,Memes aside its literally just because of no TSM or C9. The viewers on EU would be a lot less if there was no FNC too.
254,"I only watch Dig and 100t now and days, not really interested in full import teams tbh, I watch 100t because i follow the org a bit."
255,You kids will eventually discover that dota2 is the superior game.
256,"French academy league has similar average views as LCS now, this is crazy

And thats only one academy region"
257,"Not certain about others but I've stopped playing the game which makes it harder to get excited about proplay. I played non-stop for around 8 years and then woke up one day and just uninstalled.

At first I still watched lcs every weekend but honestly by the time playoffs rolled around I was just watching TSM and by the time playoffs were over not even that."
258,"For me it the multiple adds between anything. I get it and a add here and there is ok, but every f*king thing? Common, also the desk is not cutting in for me."
259,"not gonna lie, Doublelift was one of the only reasons I even watched LCS."
260,I am assuming this counts costreams? But ya whenever I watch NA games the viewership has been low on both YT and Twitch. At the start of last year I thought it was actually rebroadcasts because the views were often so low.
261,"I only watch the vods, so I'm part of the problem.  Can't be assed to sit through a bunch of content I consider irrelevant to actually see the games. I just want the games. Vods give me that option."
262,"Exactly, if they increase the games by 50% and viewership stays the same then actually viewership increases by 50%. In order to actually analyze if viewership is declining we would need to look at the total viewership per split. Hours watched is lower this split than that it was in summer split 2020. 2020 summer had abnormally high hours watched compared to other recent splits though. There does seem to be a mild overall trend of declining viewership since at least 2017 though."
263,[deleted]
264,I wonder how many viewers watch the streams of costreamers instead of the main stream. It’s what I prefer nowadays because the amount of downtime is more fun on their streams. I know it doesnt affect viewership but I wouldn’t be shocked if the divide is bigger with DL/Sneaky streaming this year and IWD being allowed to stream it again
265,there’s no shame in losing sleep over watching the 2021 world champions duke it out
266,"I have a similar opinion. There's still some good stuff in the LCS - the casters (Flowers especially), Dash, some historical matchups, a handful of interesting players to follow. The new studio and visuals are pretty cool too. But the GAMEPLAY is just so sad and watching this circus at late night hours will just put you to sleep."
267,"It's not even fun anymore, it's not like it's good fiesta

Just 2 bad teams waiting to lose.  CLG is just dead inside"
268,"Definitely this. I used to watch both but nowadays the second game starts at the same time the LCS used to finish.

Also extreme downtime in between games, I dont enjoy them in LEC and sure as hell am I not enjoying them at 1 am."
269,Nothing better than watching LCS games at 3 AM….or later for most of Europe
270,"Same. LCS broadcast is too late for EU now, but I remember watching a few years ago. Probably because they want to cram in 2 hours of pre-match nonsense every broadcast."
271,"Its almost inexcusable that, here on the east coast of the states, these games still start in the late afternoon on a freaking weekend. Fridays I can understand, but to still start so late on a Saturday or Sunday? LCS’s really got to fix their scheduling."
272,"Yes, people like to blame the level of play or other things that I'm sure impact the viewership to an extent but for sure most of the blame has to be the timeslots. As an EU viewer I can comfortably watch first two games of Sunday at best.

Even if by some miracle NA wins worlds viewership won't change much unless timeslots change as well"
273,Yeah NA games start around 11pm and end at 3-4 am. I cant always watch em.
274,"I'm from EU and i think the time these games start it isn't their main downfall, LCK starts in the worst times for both EU and NA audience and it still has the highest viewrship numbers"
275,It would be interesting to compare dip in viewership between LCS and lec during the analyst desk and pre-game segments. I swear people just tune out during LCS post game and analyst desk where as lec they stick around.
276,Yep
277,"Sponsors and quality of the games are really important

I just have to mute the stream when they spam adds"
278,"Also, our team sucking historic levels of bad doesn't help either."
279,"Plus, let’s be honest, this was the worst finals ever. A complete 3-0 stomp, it felt like a first round series, lol. No hype, no pressure. When CLG 3-0d TSM I was watching it live at MSG, even though it was a 3-0 it was the most hype 3-0 to watch because it was a moment of utter disbelief like “holy shit Doublelift is doing it, CLG is doing it” plus the playstyle CLG used with Yasuo counter and the insane Jinx pentakill, it was probably the best 3-0 I ever saw. But man, if I traveled to watch this finals live to see 3 complete shit stomps like that, I would be furious."
280,Same here! Then by the time I wake up twitter spoils it so no point watching aha
281,"I suspect the start time is the biggest factor. Sure, there are more minor factors like the broadcast and things but I am sure time matters most. They should start the games at 4 pm New york time and then they get more audience (9PM UK time instead of 11.30 pm UK time)."
282,I am an EU C9 fan since 2013/2014 and this is the season that I watched the least of my favourite team and it´s extra sad because perkz (my favourite player) in on C9 :(
283,"Definitely time slot for me too. I actually had more interest than before becaiae I like the current C9 lineup a lot, but wasn't able to watch because it stats way too late this year. So I watched mostly vods. Na production stepped up a lot this year so I don't think that's the reason. The average game quality though is terrible if you are used to LEC."
284,This is my reason. I'm in bed and sleeping before game 1 starts.
285,"I used to watch both, but now I only watch my native EU.

NA games start too late, and the whole production is force-fed capitalism. Might as well have a sponsor for Everytime someone breathes. I understand you gave the financial commitments that require sponsorship but look at the LEC and hoe they do it. Its not rammed down our throats like billboards at Time Square."
286,Yeah I literally live in na and only watch lec purely because of the time it’s at. I never watch lcs live but watch the vids all the time which stats like this don’t count.
287,"Most of the time i would have the time to watch LCS but I only watch the Games from TSM, TL and 100T when they have a good enemy. Otherwiese the time isn't worth it to watch Games that remind me of SoloQ."
288,"I think a lot of people just move on also, over the past few years the amount I play league has gone down which also means I don't watch lcs even either"
289,"It is interesting that whenever these threads come up, how many EU people come in and comment, about one thing or another. More than NA fans commenting it seems. There seems to be fewer and fewer NA fans in general ."
290,"This, but also I feel like the games skill level isn't as good so it just doesn't feel as intense. Plus their team used to be much more likable and enthusiastic. I'm just not that entertained by NA ATM and then you add the late starts on top of it so I just don't bother."
291,Roles have just swapped over the years where EU production used to be a hot mess while it is now one of the reasons EU is getting good viewing numbers while NA production has been on a decline for years.
292,"For me it's purely about the starting time, not at all about those players. In the past I was able to watch peak League of Legends live with DIG vs REN, but now IF the first match start in time I might be able to watch part of it before already having too little sleep Sunday to Monday (getting up at 5:25 doesn't really make watching games past 23:00 or so an option), and even on Saturday I tend to not go to bed too late on a regular basis (that worked when I was 20, not past 40). I try to keep a somewhat regular sleeping schedule, which means I basically check Reddit the next day to say whether any of the matches was really interesting, and if not only check the results. Meanwhile I do regularly check LCK and LPL matches live when it's quiet at work, and sometimes even some PCS, LJL and other regions. I think I've watched about as many LJL matches this year as I watched LCS or CBLOL/LLA matches. The only region I watched fewer matches from was VN, and that's because their split got cancelled."
293,"Definitely the time slot, games starting at 23:00 my time means sunday is basically dead for me when I work my regular 5:30-14:00 (what is sleep lul).

Also watched all the LCS that I’ve seen this season through costreams, so they’re sort of voluntarily bleeding viewers there. I just enjoy the calmer commentary of Snacky and the bois better at that time of night"
294,"Also, EU production improving year after year while NA is forcing more and more cringe sponsors and bad segments that nobody cares about. The cast is fine, but everything around it on the broadcast has become way less enjoyable than a couple years ago."
295,"As an NA resident, for me it's the retirement of so many memorable players. LCS used to have so many great personalities. I would watch their streams for hours and became emotionally invested in watching them perform every week on stage. These days LCS is just a bunch of replaceable players who change teams every other split."
296,"idk when lcs started but 6hours after lec finals start should be a safe bet since we've had g2 vs fnatic go on for 5hours plus you got post game interviews and pgl.

That said i think that was the scheduling since i tuned in for game 2 that ended around 0:30 ish gmt +1. There is really no good way to go about it for finals, either they overlap or they dont and it will be bad for eu viewers."
297,"Idk how about you guys but I can't seem to care about LCS. I used to be excited about CLG, FLY with Balls/Meteos/Hai and C9 with Sneaky."
298,NA used to get the best timeslot for EU now its from 11 or sometimes 12 up to 3 am
299,"> the retirement of our most well-known players in Bjerg, DL, Sneaky, etc have negatively affected the attractiveness of the LCS.

Fixed it. People watched the LCS for these players and known personalities.

Also; *everything* being sponsored and the casters and everyone else having to shill every 30 seconds. That hurts too. Other leauges have sponsors too but it's nowhere near the cringeworthy level of NA.

Look at how much the FPX gold lead has grown during the Red Bull Power Play and here's the 'whatever' replay!"
300,"LCS was always propped up by EU viewers. LEC used to have terrible scheduling combined with NA having great timeslots for EU viewers meant it was easier for EU viewers to watch NA than it was EU.

Not that LCS cant rely on high European viewership, its plummeted."
301,"Not even international performances really, watching LCS players run it down for 30 minutes with a 25 minute pause in-between will kill ant viewership tbh"
302,"I think production and content quality, especially 2020 was big factor"
303,"Yeah, the scheduling is terrible for EU viewers. I think most of the NA viewers can watch LEC but EU has to stay up too late if we want to watch NA games. So we get their viewers but they can't get ours."
304,"Na always had more viewers, more money, better schedules, better structure and still seems to be lacking."
305,"> and the retirement of our best players in Bjerg, DL, Sneaky, etc

I only tuned in to follow them. i have no one to really follow so idc. i guess Broxah too, but i couldn't bear to watch his games :("
306,"I used to watch NA LCS alot just for bjergsen, easily my favorite player. Now that hes gone I don’t find myself watching as much. LEC has been much more interesting with more competition, + timings are actually good so I can catch games more often"
307,"> Poor scheduling for EU viewers

This is it for me. I can't recall having watched a single LCS  game this season.

But I'm also really annoyed by the huuuuge breaks between LCS games. In the LEC a best of 5 goes by okayish timewise but there is so much wasted time between LCS games that I get pissed off after the first match. And I also heavily dislike their stupid over the top advertising like calling brand names into ace's or whatever."
308,">Poor scheduling for EU viewers

I tried watching some games, it fucked over my sleep schedule..."
309,"Old heads leaving like Jatt, Doublelift and even Bjerg made me not invested nearly as much. Especially during the regular season. 

Lock in tournament and playoffs were decent, but I just cannot care about regular season anymore. I don't have any investment in any team (Really I just followed Doublelift since the Epik Gamer/Dreamhack days) and rarely any of the newer players.

Lack of a crowd also doesn't help. Analyst desk is okay but I think the NA casters (Captain Flowers, Azael, Kobe and yes even Phreak) are probably my favorite aspect about the LCS now. I watch The Dive pretty much every new episode I see and it's super enjoyable."
310,"> consistently poor international performances

So much this, I have no interest in watching a region that can't show up at worlds or MSI. Why bother? When I could watch the LEC and watch the seasonal progression of MAD, G2, FNC and RGE."
311,"Not true about the viewers, Eu had better views in S5-6 just on different channel. 

There are more reason for the decline in numbers for Na.  Quality of the league is a big one, poor casting/desk outside of Kobe/flower duo is also a huge reason.  No one wants to listen to crumbz talking about his t-shirts."
312,I think covid plays some role here too. It's genuinely just not as exciting to watch people in a silent little room playing league. It feels less like an event and more like just watching some random steamer.
313,"> retirement of our best players in Bjerg, DL, Sneaky

this is such a shit reason. every region has big personalities leave/retire. that doenst kill the region. problem is that there are no new personalities, not that the old ones are gone"
314,"Idk ab poor scheduling for EU viewers, as an EU watcher, the games started at 10PM. And sure, if a series went full 5 Games i would end up staying up at 3AM. But the finals was nice as it ended at 12AM. I would prefer it to start around 9PM or 10PM as it currently does. The MAIN problem has always and will always be what day its played. The FINALS was played on a Sunday, meaning when i have to leave early for work i cant stay up until 12AM to watch the freaking FINALS. Move that shit up to Saturday broadcast wth are you thinking."
315,"Few thoughts to add to this that make the broadcast less enjoyable for me

1. I feel like most of the analyst desk is just ass at their job.  I genuinely don't feel riot put an emphasis on paying top talent and basically just felt they could fit in whoever.  The lack of quality definitely shows. To make it worse the analyst desk is way to long between games

2. The commercialization of lcs is to a level of obnoxious that's just unbearable.  You can't go 30 seconds without hearing some dumb shit like ""verizon vision score."" It absolutely is a huge reason I personally do not like watching anymore.  

3. The most obvious issue is the clear lack of quality in teams.  Huge money is spent on imports who come over and deliver sub par performances.  In EU it genuinely feels like the top EU teams will have a shot at making deep run at worlds.  NA we will be lucky to even get out of groups."
316,"There needs to be a pointed discussion on what exactly the LCS wants to do moving forward. Because, to me, it looks as if LCS is just more interested in looking like traditional sports instead of just embracing itself. 

The most universally loved new batch of content this season was “Next Level” in which certified meme guy Meteos and Kaizen would host a round table discussion with essentially everybody that was a portion of the league scene who passed a Covid test. That genuine feel of a show that wasn’t propped up to name 8 or 9 sponsors all the time was a breath of fresh air to myself and, I believe, a good amount of people. 

Without even discussing the amount of time and energy that is always pumped into ads and advertisers, the LCS is not a completely worthwhile experience. I watch for the games and I absolutely turn it off when twitch “accidentally” plays ads during the game broadcast. That’s happened multiple times this year by the way."
317,"We consistently ignore the biggest problem NA faces.  We are a console society, and those who play PC, often gravitate toward shooters. Riot has done an abysmal job of reaching NA teens to play their game, one of the biggest demographics that play games and contribute to viewership.  The game isn't the newest, hottest thing on the market, and if Riot doesn't put in actual work to reach middle and high schoolers, the numbers are going to continue to fall.  This means implementing way better avenues to entry, maybe even having a beginners stream that explains abilities each time.  League is confusing for a new player and Riot does a terrible job helping people learn.  New player advertising and onboarding must improve.  Period."
318,"can confirm i was watching only for DL and for clg when they were not being red lantern 0-15. still a fan, but man, our games are literally unwatchable"
319,"ALso NA have no NA players, but we can keep pretending that doesn't matter if u want."
320,The game is probably also losing popularity in NA as younger players don't find League that attractive and the older players moved on with their life. Some will continue to watch but a lot will just stop all league content completely.
321,NA used to get more viewers because - as you said - it was scheduled to be convenient to both viewer bases. But it also gimped EU by  making its scheduling inconvenient and also dictating the styling of the broadcast. LEC rebranding shows how much NA head held EU broadcast back.
322,I think the Eu viewing time hurts the most. As NA fan I watch EU just as much as I watch LCS. But its much later in EU by the time their league is over and for us We can wake up to LEC and by lunch time its LCS time. So EU gets tons of NA eyes while NA gets little EU eyes.
323,"For me the on air talent for lcs is just horrible. Flowers, Kobe, Emily and Dash are the only 4 I wouldn't get rid of"
324,NA analyst desk is horrible too. They really need some interesting people and stuff to talk about
325,"I disagree. I think viewership is low because NA is just boring. There’s not much to change to fix it unless the region as a whole develops a new style of play. The skill level is just not there. Sure they can compete with the best when push comes to shove, but the play style isn’t as aggressive, risky or skillful as the asian regions. I’ve never felt the **urge** to watch an NA game."
326,That and the constant advertisement thrown in your face at every fucking opportunity.  It’s insufferable.
327,Doesn’t mention the fact that they keep removing talent  (and talent keeps moving on) that we like to watch. I genuinely think this was the absolute worst year to watch LCS on-air talent wise.
328,na used to have way more viewers no more than 1-2 years ago its just this year i think that eu has more
329,You forgot terrible teams. The bottom teams in NA are just utter garbage.
330,"> Bjerg, DL, Sneaky, etc have negatively affected the attractiveness of the LCS.

Dude, these players all had years to raise the level of the region. They just didn't.

Trying to blame it on names leaving is only a good argument if your fans are complete morons who think these ""messiahs"" were going to do something... when they never did.

That's cargo cult mentality."
331,Tbf T1 vs DK in a Bo5 is on a different level than TL vs 100t
332,"Lcs just can’t catch a break

Lck flame horizons lcs both in and out of the game!"
333,"tbf, 100T vs TL was a match between a fairly new, non legacy team vs TL which is possibly the least popular of the big 3, during a very unfriendly timeslot, was a quick 3-0. On the other hand it's T1 and Faker, the legendary team back in form, vs DK the defending world champion during a time when the entire world could actually watch."
334,"I know for a lot of people it's the lack of recognition of the roster

Noone wants to root for people they don't know"
335,"Which is pretty crazy considering South Korea has less than 1/6th the population of the US alone, without counting Canada."
336,Did LCK get more NA viewers than LCS too?
337,Wow its almost like one culture is heavily invested in video games and online tournaments and the other isn't!
338,Lol I never thought about that but yeah. There are so many breaks and ads. I usually end up playing a game and have the broadcast muted on my second monitor
339,">After a game finishes I can load up an ARAM and they still won’t be onto the next game before my game finishes.

literally what we did during PLAYOFFS, the most exciting part of the season. if the time between games is so boring obviously viewers will leave"
340,"Yes, this is the main reason I don't watch LCS + most of the segments are boring and pointless"
341,"Not to mention that it's hard to watch the ""analyst"" desk when you see who's usually in it. Aside from Dash and Emily who are amazing, and Mark who's pretty good (but should be casting), I'm never really attracted to watching them analyze games. Kaizen? Usually says wrong things, came out of nowhere when there are a lot more people that could be in the desk providing deep insight. I don't hate Crumbz as many people here do, but he's at best mediocre when analyzing the game, and at worst he says things that are completely opposite of what just happened, and so on."
342,It's actually so much better than any other game. Literally the game is on for the entire time and you get to take a break and do something else between games. You don't have to watch any of the stuff you are talking about. Nothing like touchdown/kickoff commercials...
343,"Eh, LEC does it the same way with game, ads, interview, ads, analysis, ads, then game again. Not saying it's a good way to do it, but it can't actually be a detractor of NA vs EU broadcast. 

Personally I think they should get rid of the single ad break between the interview and the analyst desk if they want the show to have a better flow."
344,"Lol my man, I do the same if I have NA LCS on the side. Although I don't watch as much anymore but ya there is so much downtime it's crazy."
345,"LCS is literally what every non-American hates about American sports, but on steroids."
346,I literally cannot enjoy a replay without fucking ad sellouts ruining it
347,God bless NFL RedZone for giving us a break from that shit too
348,I like that with EU i know exactly how much time between games/analysts/etc. never changes
349,"Which is the same for every fucking region. The breaks are not a NA thing. You can play an aram watching EU or NA. You suggest to get rid of the analyst desk? If so, this would kill the LCS in no time. Just games without context. That's the most boring thing I could imagine."
350,"Yeah, the format sucks. I literally just close the stream for like a half hour when a game ends. You wouldn’t catch me doing that a few years ago. The analyst desk is also… worse? Idk how to describe it, it just seems much more surface level and uninteresting compared to what it was before."
351,"Spot on, the player interactions are boring asf, there's hardly any personality in this dead league."
352,I second this. No disrespect to the LCS casters/panelists but the difference between NA and EU casters is staggering. I really like Tigeress and Dash but sjokz and Vedius are another level.
353,"They seem allergic to letting players build fans, there are players with personality but we never get to see it. Whether they deny interviews or the production doesn't ask them. They are baby stepping by letting players on desk after games now and then."
354,"> Some dead weight talent needs to be let go. 

This especially. I can't tell if it's NA production forcing them into some very stale personalities, or the talent is just straight bad, but something's gotta change. 

Either let them go nuts like LEC with some of their ridiculous skits, or bring on some new people if the current ones don't have anything creative to contribute."
355,"They need what the LEC did. Major revamp of brand and content, and bring in fresh faces to add more personality.

I miss Jatt - he's not the cure but he's a flavour in the cast that's sorely missing"
356,"Agreed until the last statement

I honestly think all of the LCS casters are super talented but the desk definitely needs work

I think bringing in Emily has helped the desk a lot but the res still much to be done imo"
357,"I think most of the actual broadcast faces are pretty talented. Kaizen and Crumbz are really the only two that don’t feel like they bring much to the table and detract from the energy or knowledge of the rest.  It’s just that even the super talented ones are poorly directed in the way of content and structure. They’re not encouraged to talk about deeper aspects of the game and teams and league, and aren’t given time to dive into micro decisions when they always feel rushed between games without time to discuss much.

Quickshot talked recently about how the hardcore fans don’t realize how much of the audience is actually pretty casual and only tune in for a few games per year or playoffs, and there’s merit to making sure the broadcast is accessible to them. But the LCS production feels like it’s too invested in that direction. Casual fans will enjoy high level analysis when it’s presented accessibly and entertainingly, it’s what hooks people in to the pro scene"
358,"I’m from NA and I don’t hate the NA casters, but I definitely like the EU ones better. I feel like they have a ton more personality and good chemistry together!"
359,"I’ve been meaning to make a long post breaking down everything that I think is wrong with the NA broadcast but it’s too long and the core issue is that it just needs new direction. Every part of the broadcast is worse than other regions by a wide margin. Individually I don’t particularly mind any of the NA talent, but as a total broadcast it falls so short. Personally, I think this is because they lack proper direction and in certain areas (sorry observers but you guys are dogshit) lack ability."
360,I honestly don’t believe that it’s because of the low number of NA players. Otherwise teams like DIG would be really popular. It’s because of poor international performances.
361,"I agree here.

Three people that you mentioned are people with character/attitude that differs them from the rest. Phreak has become stale, even with his recent image rebuild to an angry dad. Others are just generic stereotypes of sport/esports broadcast."
362,"I used to watch all of LCS despite the broadcasting time being brutal. I hate the long pauses between games and especially the analyst desk that has nothing insightful to say. It's the main reason why I've moved to watching DLs co-stream.

Casters are world class (especially Flowers and Phreak), but I would cull everyone on the analyst desk outside of Dash who is trying his hardest to carry the rest. Maybe let Raz stay too as he's at least pleasant to listen to. Bring back Jatt.

And most of all fire the entire observation team and the person responsible for hiring them. The spectator looks like it's managed by a bot. Always looking in the wrong places. People having a death match in the top lane? Better to pan to bot lane before we see who wins. I can only assume ClakeyD is no long the observer. 

The canyon compared LEC production is just insane. There are no replays or stats after fights. We want to see how much damage players dealt."
363,I agree with most of this but Emily Rand is a super welcome addition imo
364,"Actually I think Phreak has gotten better over the years quite a lot. Azael is also good. 

Phreak flaming pro players is my favorite thing in NA. It's actually mindblowing some of the misplays that happen in NA, a region with so much money behind it."
365,Le tigress is just so painful compared to the genuine excitement that Ovilee used to bring
366,Replays that feel like they take 5 hours.
367,"Hey Phreak and Azael have been great too, they hype up plays"
368,"lcs brought on a vtuber to the analyst desk and they were somehow the least cringe and most knowledgeable person there. observers have been terrible, replay team has been terrible, and no team has any “must watch” players. it makes for an experience that ranges from boring (due to teams only making safe plays and slow macro) to frustrating (when a fight happens or you notice something important/impressive but there’s no replay and the casters don’t notice)"
369,"I also enjoy Azael and Phreak for their willingness to call out horrible decision making or mechanical missplays during games. 

Sometimes if players go full int mode and the casters try to pretend it didn't happen it just makes it worse for any viewer who knows how embarrassing the missplay/decision making is."
370,"I would give credit to Phreak and Azael because their casts are mostly enjoyable. Emily is new but she is really trying to make the analyst desk interesting. 

personally, I don't really find any appeal in the rest. Crumbz and Markz need to reinvent themselves a bit. Their personalities were fine in 2017, but are overdue for some refresh. I am not sold on the rest of the on air team."
371,"yeah i honestly dont really like any of the new generation of talents, they all seem like the kind of talent that has dozens of accolades and degrees in entertainment, but i like the more amateurish feel of old generation casters where it feels like they are just your bro watching a tv show with you"
372,"I think its interesting that a lot of people have identified worlds performance as a problem for viewership, including the owners. As someone who also has been watching lcs since season 2 it felt like we at least had someone to root for and even if they didn't perform well at worlds there was still the investment of seeing which NA players throughout the season showed promise for worlds. Now, as someone above pointed out, there are 0 native NA players in the top team. I 100% agree with you that if you are importing players, market it as a league of gathering players from around the world as NA is a melting pot region, or go back to the roots of homegrown talent, but right now we are in this state of terrible retirement identity and a league that markets towards NA fans with nobody from NA to root for."
373,Also from NA if it matters and I think that if the two LMS teams outperform NA at worlds this year it will be hilarious. From what I read on here PSG Is good so it would be interesting to see if NA ranks 5th in performance this year. Am I too optimistic to think that would push the league to change and improve? Probably.
374,"I can literally get a full workout in between every LCS game, it's hilariously terrible."
375,"It's gonna take a year or 2 before we are filled with actual NA talents. The new academy system is working its course, NA was just too late to the party compared to LEC and LPL"
376,No sneaky no viewers
377,"That era when Doublelift was on TSM was always so hype and even when he switched to TL it was still hype because they were just so dominant. 

I can’t help but think the item changes and the general direction Riot took League kind of took away how players can express themselves individually. I think item changes made it so playstyles have to fit into a certain mould and even though it’s possible to deviate from it, it’s risky and much more difficult to do."
378,"It's only one factor.  Views was already declining last year with both. 

It's just hard to watch a league with poor schedule, competition, quality, casting/desk and with tons of add/pause and narrative based analysis"
379,Soren is coaching
380,"Teamfight starts

*Pans camera away*"
381,"Yep, for instance I don't need to watch the Jungler farm for 2 minutes. Show me how the laners are trading and setting up their lanes. I could care less about the Jungler in the early game if I want to watch them path I can watch proview."
382,"Sneaky has been mentally breaking at the observers recently, it's hilarious to see him slowly get to point of screaming every weekend."
383,"Also, it seems like a lot of the comments/analysis are very general and almost designed to newer players. I like the detail analysis that EU goes into with certain plays/picks/breakdowns."
384,Honestly I think they should offer the job of observer to retired pros. I bet there's plenty who would think it's a cool job to have and they would be great at it with their game knowledge. Just little things like always toggling vision when someone is in brush waiting to gank and we're seeing if the laner steps up far enough etc
385,This is a big reason I don't watch. My favorite player retired so I'm not super invested in the outcomes of games anymore. What I want to do is kick back and watch the game. I don't really care if it isn't the most high level gameplay. What bothers me is the fact they actively pan away from the plays to watch someone kill krugs.
386,"Its not about LCS broadcast showcasing talent. They do it all the time with hype videos, interviews, and desk segments. 

Its because the viewerbase doesn't give a shit about new faces, they want Bjerg, DL, and Sneaky. 

Spica is out here trying his best to make a name for himself, meanwhile CoreJJ had to practically do PR for Tactical his first year on TL."
387,It's way easier to build up personalities when your region performs at international events. You can put lipstick on a pig but I still wouldn't kiss it.
388,"Hold on, you don't want to watch this half hour video of has-beens people like talking on couches? /s"
389,"Hell, Brazil has even less success than NA internationally, has many less players, but has almost the same amount of viewers. People tend to support their home region whether it is good or bad. Thing is that NA doesn't feel like NA anymore since NA players are a minority in their own league.

I'm in the same boat, watched NA in S3 but watched less the more imports they got. Even as a European, I'm bored by the amount of imports in LCS. It just makes it so uninteresting, because I can already watch LEC to see European players and LCK to see Korean players."
390,"For me it started last year, and then *definitely* this year, I just don't care about NA at all.  Why would I follow teams that are just going to get absolutely curbstomped at the competitions that actually matter?  I just don't buy into the old ""yeah but what if we end up actually being good this year then you'll be mad you got off the train"" mentality.  Like no I'm pissed that I felt the need to get off already because of how consistently terrible we are, that's a THEM problem not a ME problem."
391,"same, i actually let myself get deluded into getting hyped for c9 at msi because i thought they looked really strong. and now we're seeing people hype 100t"
392,"Hey, I'm an EU fan and I don't think MSI was \*embarrassment\* for C9, sure it was underwhelming but they managed to take a few games here and there from the TOP teams."
393,">LEC has grown cuz of international succes made by FNC and G2.

 100% agree. People can talk all they want about ""personalities"" and ""branding"" but in the end nobody cares if you suck on the big stage. Branding helps you capitalize better on success, but you need to have the success in the first place.

 Newer people dont know that LEC (EU LCS back then) was also on a downward trajectory before Fnatic and G2 started to have consistent relevancy on an international level. Especially G2 was a hated team because they sucked at their first MSI/Worlds. But when they started being successful, everyone suddenly started falling in love with their ""personalities""

 TLDR: Being actually good on the big stage is what you get fans and viewership, everything else is just extras"
394,"EU used to be the no personality all nerdy gamers while NA had the ""cool"" people who all streamed and got u invested into the teams , that also helped viewership"
395,"People say this and then also flame Evil Geniuses for having an eye on the international game with their intent and approach. Go to the EG vs C9 thread and you're going to relentlessly see the meme *EG forgot to compete internationally you have to win in NA*. They maybe got a little obnoxious with how they pencilled themselves into worlds after 1 good split but the league needs more of that perspective.

People aren't tuning out of NA because of bad international performances. They're tuning out because most of our teams are boring and focused on the set play. You can actually set your watch to a lot of teams' entire early games and no one challenges these tendencies. The finals were actually a treat to watch because Closer was actually thinking about the game more than 30 seconds ahead and he completely manhandled the best setplay team in the league in TL."
396,"LEC has grown because:  


1. we have fucking good teams
2. we have fucking great talent on the broadcast
3. we have owners like carlos who would be able to carry the region with his shittalk alone
4. we have storylines like G2 vs FNC while the biggest one in NA of TSM vs CLG is literally a meme
5. a consistent format
6. good watching hours
7. literally every team has something to offer story wise  from year of the duck in astralist through Patric in Excel up to the biggest Rekkles vs FNC

and many many more."
397,Indirectly. The international success made more EU players stay there. It isn't anymore that EU teams lose their fan favorite players to NA on a regular basis.
398,"Dig has 5 NA players, just be a fan of them lol"
399,"> I just can't give two shits about imports who collect a fat check and still lose just as much as the native NA talent.

Doesn't this go exactly against your earlier diatribe? Like you were just bitching about how the top 4 teams have only 4 NA players (including 100T in there) but you're saying that the imports just collect a fat check and lose? If they just lose, why are those the best 4 teams by far? All the majority NA teams are just, frankly, garbage, and if they can't beat retirement level players (your words) from other regions then that's NA's fault. It's not like they are holding back a flood of NA talent. NA just has no talent."
400,"Hey come on man , he has a reputation to keep"
401,Yeah the breaks are fucking brutal. As a 100T fan personally I was watching with my 3 cousins over discord and we would legitimately have time for a aram game in between games and would catch the tail end of champ select almost everytime. That is like a 15-20 min swing in-between games and that's sad. The breaks we're almost as long as the series lol
402,"It's a little crazy to me that they used to only do 3-4 minute breaks but now they do a 5 minute break (3 + ads), quick interview, another 5 minute break, analyst deck, another 5 minute break, then the next game. I figure games used to last longer so they had to have shorter run times, but come on, make a snappier product. There's a reason baseball has rules on in between inning times, basketball and football have time caps for time outs, etc."
403,They didn’t step up production. Production is the worst it’s ever been by far and it’s not even close. The people they brought in are awful add nothing and mostly don’t play league at all. If I wanted to watch mental health evaluations I would watch dr Phil. Worst production I’ve ever seen in an esports or any sporting event for that matter. I was watching lck laughing my ass off and enjoying production fully. NA has to be turned off I feel cringe watching it it’s that bad.
404,"What lasts longer:

1 Morgana Q or 1 LCS break?"
405,Also don’t make me wait for 30 mins looking at a timer half of that time between games. How fucking dog shit
406,"Legitimately 2 hours of BS before game start... turn on LCS, remember this crap happens, turn off LCS.
Branding is overdone too. Hearing budlight and FTX and redbull repeated over and over is fantastic /s"
407,They already got rid of pregame analysis though
408,Its gone most of the time. they have a mini show 30 min before games except for finals weekend for some reason. Then the desk goes right into picks and draft most of the time.
409,Im gonna get downvoted but LCK and LEC would be higher level if LCS just died. I think its good for the global league scene overall.
410,"It's true, NA people kick up a stink about it but the fact there's barely any home grown talent really holds it back"
411,Imports in theory should increase viewership. I know a lot of turkish and australian fans started watching 100t games this year but the timing really sucks for us
412,"I'd wager more Americans watched the LCK finals and LEC finals than the LCS finals, so I don't think imports are a problem in and of themselves."
413,12 am* but yeah agree with all the reasons. I still watch highlights though the next day (as a European) but I'm not sure if that's included in viewership numbers
414,"The last one is really grating as someone from EU. Dunno if Americans are used to it, but it just sounds so terminally corporate. Even if I could get those services in EU I wouldn't, just out of spite."
415,"6 is a big one. NA is sending only 2 native players to Worlds. So if you wanna watch EU or KR players, why would you watch LCS, when theyre are much better ones in the LEC and LCK?"
416,"The first time I heard FTX gold advantage midgame, I closed the stream and did something else.  
I wanna watch the game and not watch an advertisement.  
Throw in ads before and after the game, but midgame just sounds way too unnatural."
417,I did a spit take the first time I saw the Bud Light Ace.
418,FTX Gold advantage is actually an amazing addition. I find myself looking for it while watching other leagues now.
419,"But hey, atleast they are diverse"
420,"Adding to this bad Gameplay, NA is just play as slow as LCK but with way lower mechanical level and bad Macro."
421,"> FTX gold advantage, statefarm analystdesk, etcetc you sold out to name every single thing after your sponsors.

this is so annoying, and ""red bull baron"" ... come on"
422,"4

only 4

the whole stream is SOOOOO FUCKING BORING outside of games

when you compare it to LEC, where LEC feels so alive, colorful and entertaining to watch. the difference is huge. LCS IS SOULLESS"
423,"Worst thing is, we might get those bullshit sponsor things during worlds. I remember from last year worlds was in China and the English broadcast was sponsored by quite a few American sponsors e.g. Mastercard, while prob being the worst times possible for NA viewers."
424,"About point 5 - I believe there is much more shittalk, but the broadcast is unable to sell it in an appeasing way. Well, they are unable to sell anything in appeasing way but I put it more on the format than the talent."
425,"I think you made the best points and alot of those points just come down to it's a worst product. On a technical production level and on a gameplay level. As I grow older, I have less and less time. So I am not gonna waste 4-5hours watching shit league. If I have nothing to do I will watch a C9 game or this split EG/100t. But most of the teams are really boring and not worth following. 

Meanwhile in EU every team had moments where they looked really good and almost made playoffs. Except for Schalke in summer and Astralis/vit in spring."
426,"> no stake, games are meaningless

how does this NA finals have less stakes than any other NA finals?

>no personalities anymore, compare doublelift shittalk era to any new adc era.

doublelifts co-stream is literally included in these numbers, add on top of that perkz, fudge, alphari, huni, plenty of other players people love too

> considered to be a retirement home for eu and korean players, why would you watch retired players play?

plenty of people watched nisqy this year after he retired"
427,"This is imo such a better answer than all the ""international success"" ones. Like seriously this new format sucks, I can't believe the only thing they found to end the spring split doesn't matter talks is this."
428,Yeah only the two worst wont be in playoffs. And we usually know one team that will be last from the beginning. So whats the point? Who will be the second worst. lol
429,"> The biggest problem for me is the format, having spring games carry over is dumb. Coupled with the 8 team playoff, it just allows teams like TL/C9 and others to fuck around all split since they'd legitimately have to lose something like 70%+ of their games to not make playoffs.. what is the point ???? Just have playoffs if you're gonna throw damn near all your teams in it anyway. It is just a waste of time to watch these games.

This is a pretty poor argument. Having Spring carry over allows for the split to actually matter and impact worlds seeding. Without championship points, it can feel as though the split means nothing but MSI qualification. Due to this, having 8 teams in playoffs makes sense to give a team with a summer resurgence a chance at playoffs. GGS for example went 3-15 in spring but rallied and made playoffs in summer. 

Sure, C9/TL could lose 70% of their games, but then they would lose the massive advantage of 3-6 or 1-2 and be forced to win 4-5 Bo5s for Worlds/Title. Any team that fucks around that long is likely not going to be building good fundamentals coming into playoffs. The punishment for fucking around isn't missing playoffs, it's losing playoffs. At the end of the day, having 2 extra teams just means there are 2 extra Bo5s, who cares at that point, just don't watch them if you don't want to."
430,"Yeah. I started the stream a couple of times over the last week, watched the last 5min of analyst desk, pick-ban and the first 10 minutes of the game. Then I realized I was bored out of my mind and turned off.

There is just... Nothing there but cringey pseudo-hype and mediocre gameplay."
431,I think the format is fine just the way that it was presented was confusing. And it's hard to generate hype when every game is a snooze fest. The only hype I felt all split was when golden guardians started popping off for like 4 games. The top teams are all coin flips as to whether they actually show up or not.
432,"I got some Drops from 100T vs TL, but those where the standard eSport Capsule + Hextech Chest stuff. So nothing to stay awake for."
433,As is tradition
434,"Definitely feels like a self inflicted wound. We expect to win Worlds cuz NA orgs constantly say it and spend millions upon millions (even throwing NA culture/players to the wayside) to make it happen, only to fall short because generally our region has always just been a minor region with tons of money. They set everything up to where it's extremely easy to disappoint and very hard to achieve what's expected...they should be reversing the expectations. CLG was great at that, always claimed the underdog role so anything even mildly good they achieved felt glorious lol NA as a whole should always try to go for the underdog storyline when abroad cuz we're just a wild card region with better odds imo."
435,"CaptFlowers is really carrying NA for me, it's unwatchable without him"
436,"Most NA fans don't have issues with the current set of imports. Most of the imports have stuck around for a while and have connected with the fans and made an effort to improve the league e.g. CoreJJ. NA has always been a melting pot and where someone was born matters very little. 

The lack of international success is what kills it for most NA fans. EU fans don't watch because of the timezone. League is very small in NA and the population is only declining."
437,"yeah, whenever i hear that i get so fucking tilted christ. Can you imagine if football casters saying budlight goal or redbull penalty."
438,"Don't you love seeing state farm ads 15 times per broadcast to the point that you can recite them from memory? I for one am shocked. 

(No offense Jake from State Farm, but as a european I'm lowkey starting to hate you)."
439,"For me it's Grubhub, hearing about it feels so damn cheap, like, can't u at least have some class with the ads?"
440,"If they didn’t do this and this post was about a lack of revenue I’d bet you would be shitting in them as well. It’s really not a big deal, and it makes it so the league makes money and can operate in the future. Having sponsors is absolutely a good thing."
441,When Europe has a red bull baron it's tasteful. When NA has a red bull baron it's selling out.
442,"The worst is when the casters forget and have to backtrack, it makes it so obviously fake and cringe. ""It's a clean ace for...  A BUD LIGHT clean ace for C9!"" 

It trips me up so much when it's so blatant and unnatural, even worse than the already weird amount of sponsored stuff."
443,"I was thinking the same thing last weekend. I remember when it was just the analyst desk and then they added more and more things. I think there is a. Grubhub one where if you die too easy you are delivering your enemy a kill like grubhub delivers food. and an escape of the game that is sponsored too if I recall. And they just throw it in when something happens even if it isn’t that great. 

It’s too much. Oh and the ads in game you see around the map. Like come on… do you really need the money from LCS sponsorships? They can’t be generating that much revenue. I thought LCS wa to promote the game and get viewers to spend money on the game."
444,Saying this 3 years ago would net you so many salty replies
445,">which mostly perform as you expect them too

Except we got a brand new split champion this summer?  First time the ORG has been good at all since they entered the league in 2018.  Same with EG, they had a huge summer, only faltering at playoffs."
446,There's no relegation in other leagues either.
447,All the orgs promoted from relegation in NA sucked. Most would last one split as a bottom feeder and than lose their spot at the end of the split. OG C9 and an LMQ team that cheated the system are the only two orgs worth a shit to come out of relegation.
448,This is such a copium statement. I still watch LCS on occasions and for me the production team does absolutely nothing to create personalities and hearing FTX gold Adv. 20 times during a game is exhausting.
449,"I really hate this shut .even if na did decent ant a tournament; thay will not disappoint the myriad of other problems that plague na, like no memorable faces, bad production, 8 hour breaks, stupid sponsorships, etc etc"
450,"No, it's not going to go up until they start marketing to the NA audience. There aren't commercials, ads on any website, crossover marketing or anything. The most they have done to introduce the game to new players is free skins from Amazon prime (which are hidden now). It's simple logic. Are kids going to play fortnight which has 15 ads get to them every day or League that they will only find on twitch or through a random search?

Getting a partnership with Steam or Epic may help because nobody looks for games outside of those platforms over here, but honestly it needs to start with Riot marketing their game."
451,"dude, LCS is outperformed by fucking Brazil and literally French regional league.... both of which probably have chaces to tie LPLs shoelaces at best.   


LCS is simply dogshit in almost every measure. Like, they literally were given one of the best stories of Huhi from dogshit mid to the very fucking top LCS support shitting on a world champ and world finalist in a span of 2 weeks... and they still managed to make it boring. 

&#x200B;

The team is also awful and should be fired fully (Cpt flowers and Kobbe excluded) when you team literally makes people switch to a random retired player who commentates on the game while eating shit you know they are overpaid useless headcount."
452,LCS could win worlds and I wouldn't care. They can't even properly catch the setup to a fight on screen. It's always an abrupt transition to the middle of the play. Then they start a replay only to cut it to watch the tail end of someone getting caught and dying.
453,Don't think NA sponsors care about EU audience. They want to maximalise NA audience And i think the time reflects that
454,"TSM, but i know exactly why i hate them."
455,"well it was NA prodcast that intentionally fucked EU. After EU got free and could do what they want, LEC is rocking it while the NA cast is still the old trash that is declining more and more and even has hard times to fight wildcard or lower leagues."
456,They got rid of Zirene and everything went to shit
457,You sound like an idiot!
458,"Tbh until I see signs of life from NA internationally, LCS just feels like which teams are being sent for the airport any % speedrun"
459,">the Vienna sausage anime girl 

The what? Having not seen it this is so random."
460,What does it seem like they're winging?
461,How crazy is it that LCS needs LLA to improve talent pool? Unthinkable years ago.
462,"I don't think the LCS cast is bad, but watching a 6 hour commercial for products I don't know and can't buy is more than I can stomach.

Double, Meteos, and Sneaky just make it so much more enjoyable to watch the LCS, and their game knowledge is S+ compared to casters."
463,"Which people in particular do you have issue with?

Personally I have not warmed to Kaizer and Raz, but I quite like Emily, Hai and others on the analyst desk, and generally quite like the casters."
464,"I need to make an active effort to pay attention to the LCS cast because god almighty is it straight up garbage.

Azael sounds like a grandma reading an aspirin drug leaflet. Dude's boredom incarnate and actively detracts from the experience.

PastryTime's diction is straight up terrible at times and, I don't know how to better explain this, but he sounds like he drools while speaking. It's just uncomfortable listening to him.


Kobe is mostly ok, but way too goofy and slow for a color caster. The fact he speaks ""smiling"" amplifies these problems. He also has periods when he starts talking about something and just doesn't let go of the issue even when it's clear he should have changed the subject by now. There was this one game a while ago with a jungle Fiddlesticks, I don't remember which team picked it, and he was constantly going on lengthy painful monologues about extremely specific things about Fiddle literally no one cared about and just didn't seem to stop.

Primal, Raz, Dash, MarkZ and LeTigress are just like Azael to me, their absence would barely be noticed. They don't add anything to the experience and are plain out boring to listen to. Crumbz on top of being forgetful, also says a fat load of straight up wrong things often.

The others are mostly ok, but I've gotta say it, I think CaptainFlowers is overrated and mostly stands out because the others are crap. His rap god moments are impressive but I don't think they actually add to the entertainment of the experience. I don't need to hear about every little step every champion took as if you were trying to follow the LCS through a radio in the middle of the desert, I need it to be entertaining and fun, which is one of the things the LEC casters seem to get while it just flies over the heads of the LCS ones. He seems to always fall back to certain gimmicks he keeps doing and it gets very repetitive to me after a while. He's specially painful to listen to when casting TSM games because he shouts ""and it's TEE  ESS EEEEEEEEM"" every other second because someone last hit a minion correctly and I hate it.

Emily is knowledgeable but the presentation is just not there. She seems very shy. Overall I think Phreak is the best one in there, but again, mostly because everything else ranges from bad to meh.

I won't even get started with all the advertising, it just makes everything about it feel cheap.


Overall, the LCS lacks the friendly and approachable, yet professional, atmosphere that the LEC casters nail down to a t. When I watch the LCS I feel like I'm watching people who just want to get their job over and done with, while when I watch the LEC it feels inviting and comfortable because they all sound like they love their job and are actively having fun doing it."
465,do you mean between games cast or in game casters ? Because there is no way in fucking hell LEC casters are better
466,no bjerg no dl no sneaky no hai no memeos nobody that most of the older fans give a rats ass about.  Jensen and Impact and even they are second generation lcs wise.  I guess wildturtle but he's rotting on clg like aphro is on dig.  Also the way that especially sneaky and dl were forced out of the scene has left a bad aftertaste for a lot of fans.
467,They have been trying that ever since the Monday night game of the week hype thingy they tried last year that completely failed.
468,"I don't know who you're talking about. By non-caster talent, I assume you're talking about the analyst desk?

I think Raz and Emily Rand have both been stellar additions. There's obviously a lot of sexism in esports and among the fans, but I was under the impression both have been really well received? I'm not sure what the response to Kaizen has been; he obviously represents the goofier side of LCS on-air talent, but I think his enthusiasm is really valuable to the broadcast, and can't imagine there's anyone that really doesn't like him. Hai is obviously trying to project a cooler persona than the one he had as a player, and I could see that being disappointing to older fans, but I can't really see a notable downside to the knowledge, experience, and the carefully but barely veiled enthusiasm he also contributes.

MarkZ has his quirks and I could see people not really vibing with his energy, but I generally think he's a valuable member of the desk as well. 

I know a lot of the aforementioned sexism seems to settle around Letigress, especially since she's seen as a replacement to Ovilee whom many in the community simp so inexplicably hard for. Is that who you're talking about? If so, what don't you like about her?

I know there's a lot of negativity toward Crumbz, but don't understand why. Could you explain if he's who you're referring to? I think people say he's not knowledgable about the game, but he routinely out-predicts former pros and the most seasoned analytical minds on the desk when it comes to match outcomes, hence his Twitter moniker of Prophet. And I generally think he's really enthusiastic as well."
469,"There was a TSM vs C9 match up in playoffs, arguably in a more important match up than the grand finals was in terms of a ticket to worlds or not. That only brought in ~320k."
470,"TSM vs c9 went the distance the series. Two titan organizations of North America with the final spot on the line. Yet it had LESS views than this finals.


For a comparison, g2 vs fnc peaked as second most viewed playoffs at 860k + 
I'm pretty sure it had less views than the eventual finals.

Something is wrong with the LCS."
471,"It’s called being honest, you want them to lie and hype up the shit show that is na? Only to be met with a huge reality check at worlds?"
472,"Or, improve your league so they have a reason not to shit on it?"
473,that will lower the number of viewers that lcs will get even more.
474,"> The new champs are just disgustingly unbalanced,

The most picked/banned champions in LEC 2021 playoffs are: Varus, Rakan, Thresh, Viego, TF, Lee Sin, Xin, Braum, Ryze, Jayce, Kalista, Ezreal, Ashe, LB, Renekton, Camille, Aphelios, Trundle, Orianna, and Leona

Of the 20 most picked and banned champions, only one is new.

So, no, you're wrong."
475,Agree on the casters. The only NA caster I enjoy is Kobe because he's just there being chill and stuff. Other than him I can't stand any of the other casters or analyst desk guys (except for Emily) and if I ever watch NA it's on mute or on a co-stream.
476,wow you sure showed that strawman who's boss.
477,well its not LEC thats dying.
478,">According to this sub this place is NA biased and more NA fans, at least that’s what the EU fans tell us

>If that’s the case shouldnt we expect NA viewership to hold?

You think reddit= viewership? so mad lions vs fnc had 700k ish viewers how come the post match thread only had 1,7k comments? whilst tl vs 100t had 300k views and 2,4k comments?

Imagine thinking viewership numbers for a regional finals= subreddit presence.

Thats so farfetched. Really living up to your name. Both are their own ecosystem thats it, everyone who watches twitch/youtube aint also browsing reddit."
479,It’s cause all of this gets posted during European hours so it just becomes a shit on NA thread most the time. If this had been posted 12 hours later it would be a completely different thread.
480,"Yes, it does"
481,100% this.  The production is the primary reason for poor viewership numbers.
482,"I’m all for bashing riot but I think this is something they got right. 
 
They want the views on their website above all else hence the rewards for it, but also encourage users thru their preferred means of viewing. Makes it easier for the casual viewer to tune in when they see it live on YouTube/twitch..
 
Out of all the games out there I will say finding the times league matches are starting is way easier than anything else.
 
I don’t know if you follow other esports but it’s a bit tricky with some of the tournament formats to find the right starting times, yet at least LoL has a single, accurate repository for all their matches that localizes to your time zone too."
483,I am on board with you.  I think the issue with players is because they are always interviewed by terrible talent.  LeTigress is just bad.  Flat out bad.  She asks dumb questions and doesn't do anything to make the interviews interesting for the viewers or for the players.
484,No one mentions it because it is said in the article that costream is included in these numbers.
485,"It was only 364,000 including co-streams"
486,"How do you figure Huhi is not an import?  His first professional league experience was in Korea.

Edit:  I looked him up.  He was awarded his EB1A visa in July 0f 2018 to become an NA resident.  He was an import before then."
487,"I'd say analyse less.
Way less.
Some games i feel the post-game stuff is almost as long as the actual game. Yeah we get it, Perkz failing a flash over a wall is bad. I dont need 4 different takes on how that impacted his performance and mindset for the remaining 20minutes of play every time."
488,They mention in the article this is including Co-streams..
489,Co-streams are part of this number which is why people arent talking about them.
490,Fudge freezing playstyle is a brightspot?
491,The production was maligned all year.  I don't know what you think they stepped up.
492,""" The esports viewership statistic site says that the LCS reached a peak of 364,000 viewers this past summer, **including co-streams ""**"
493,"[CBLOL](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/cblol-2021-split-2) too (average 103k), and it really makes me wonder how this would make the LCS sponsors feel."
494,"I wouldn't necessarily call it 'academy', just the French national league (even if it feeds talent into the LEC).

Still crazy numbers!"
495,"It is called national league, it isn't really an academy league."
496,In NA there is  lot to do. I don't see why  them having less interest than France means anything.
497,"I mean to be fair though, LFL is REALLY fucking popular, it was eclipsing LEC numbers on opening day iirc."
498,"It is interesting to watch new regionals talent. It's not to watch a league with no ingrown talents and mostly imports. When they franchised LCS promised it would be a safety net to develop NA scene and grow talent without the fear to drop out of the league. 

The reality is that they used the money to buy more imports, killing the league viewership in the process."
499,"I feel so happy not to be alone in this. When it comes to discussion about the game with people that still play the game I typically tell them I stopped playing because I exhausted all of the content. I played up until Season 9's start.   


The reality of it was that I didn't exhaust the content, it was that the content that was being recycled to me wasn't the same stuff that got me hooked into the game initially. I'm OK with ending my relationship with Riot Games. It's very much one sided where I'm leaving them. I tried Valorant for a couple months only to get the same initial vibes of what League had to offer. Riot cannot satisfy me anymore and I'm OK with that."
500,"You’re not alone. I exclusively watched LCS for DL and Bjerg, then they both retired lmao"
501,"Yup, it was LiftLift and Sneaky for me.  Otherwise NA is a retirement village for players who can't hack it in major regions anymore."
502,"I enjoyed watching him compete. I watched maybe a third of the games this split through his costream. There just isn't another player I want to follow. I'm sure some of them are interesting, but I don't feel like investing the time in them."
503,"This comes up every single time someone talks about or posts a link from escharts. They do include costreams, it's been confirmed from adding up stream numbers separately and they've also confirmed on their website and on twitter thousands of times at this point."
504,Costream numbers are included
505,bro.. i have news for you..
506,I watch maybe 1 game live and the rest through costream highlights.
507,I don't want spoilers for the main event that's why
508,How many teams does Iceland need to deny visas in order that that timeline to happen?
509,"Pretty much all league is a waste of time unless you are watching the best teams from whatever league you are watching. Lck 1 v lck 8 is boring. 

Lck 1 v lck? Pure probably going to have a good time. 

NA is a meme, but let’s not pretend that EU is a masterclass of league either."
510,"I don't understand why the adverts doesn't play during the 3:00.  Like we have 3:00 break where some 'stationary' ads are shown, but there are still statefarm/honda etc ads as well.

I literally start up an ARAM in between games, and just like miss the first 2m or so."
511,The downtime is what keeps me from actively watching anything other than LPL. It's just overall the best league to watch.
512, Yeah it starts at like 4 in parts of asia. Not like i would watch it anyway but yeah
513,"Yea everyone is talking about how it's great for NA but the schedule for me sucks since I'm on the east coast, I actually wound up watching way more lec games because of the time slot"
514,"I'm not sure what's the rules in the US, but with sponsor like budlight it make sense they will try to target a more adult audiance, later in the day."
515,"Yeah, NA could be dominating everything, with 10 of the best teams in the galaxy, and it would still not make me want to purposely stay up from 23 to 5 in the morning to watch it. 

When you cut out the rest of the world, you limit your audience. That doesn't have to be a problem - Kamine Korp alone can draw more viewers than the average LCS game can casting only in French, and they are not even in a Worlds qualifying league - but then you have to do a *lot* more to get your viewers on board with your product. LCS just haven't done much to get that level of attention."
516,I actually wonder how many viewers are actually sleeping. Numerous times I have been watching the 1st or 2nd game and then suddenly wake up with the stream over.
517,"
>to blame the level of play

As a European viewer I don't care how bad NA is. And they aren't as bad as people make it out to be. But I used to watch it because the show was better than anything EU did. NA players were the stars compared to players in Europe. This is why I watched. I liked the people there. It's different nowadays of course. While we have someone as articulate as Bwipo, NA has their typical shy ""stereotype gamer"" guys. But Jizuke brought at least some light to NAs scene. That dude is funny and isn't afraid to straight up int on stage. And I love it"
518,"LCK starts at like 9 or 10am for EU, that's perfect times for anyone with home office or streams at work, which is a ton of people now. Not to mention students who usually have holidays during summer playoffs"
519,"Yeah, but NA time is Not only inconvenient, but also really low level of play."
520,"Just a thought about the analyst desk. When was the last time felt like it was teaching you anything instead of just seeing replays of the last game?

I don't know if anyone has improved it in this regard but I skip the analyst desk no matter the stream because it feels meaningless."
521,"Just anecdotally, I do that. I don't like to just hard flame the AD or casters, but LEC analyst desk just interests me more"
522,EU production before the rebrand was literally just NA production working stupid hours at least according to quick shot.
523,"This is a good documentary about the EU LCS and how everything used to be run out of the NA LCS. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n1GAk_qXlU

You can really see the difference in how successful LEC became after they broke free of being managed by LCS, in order to do their own thing going in their own direction, with the broadcast managed out of the Berlin office."
524,EU production was just whatever leftovers they got from NA + on site staff for physical stuff.
525,"The big switch was that the LEC was under the umbrella of NA when it was LCS.EU and couldn't fully make their own decisions, such as on scheduling. Franchising gave the LEC it's independence and they were suddenly free to make their product how they wished."
526,"I truly love just about every single NA and EU caster.  I think both groups are incredibly talented.  The host counterparts, Skojz and Dash are both top notch.  The interview counterparts of LeTigress and Laure Valee are both incredible personalities as interviewers.  

Other than that, I really don't enjoy anyone else on the NA analyst desk.  I think Emily is incredibly smart and knows here League, but there's a huge something lacking from the personality standpoint.  Same exact feelings toward MarkZ, smart but boring. I loved Hai as a player, but find his analyst points cringy.  He somehow always manages to make whatever they're talking about about him and about how he would perform in the same situation.  Like dude...  Primal and Raz are both decent, but still not exciting to me.  

I say all that, but regardless, I think I watched every single LEC and LCS game this year.  That said, I have watched almost zero of them *live*.  I watch almost exclusively through EventVods.com, on my own time, often throughout the workweek.  I wonder how many other players watch this way and how they're counted in terms of viewership.  

From a competitive standpoint, I thought this was some of the best competition we've ever had in both leagues.  Both leagues featured a full 5 teams that genuinely could have won it all.  I was rooting hard for EG by the end of the season, only to watch them sputter.  It was definitely one of the tightest seasons.  

I also absolutely love the meta right now.  Dives, roaming, strong macro, jungle and support oriented, faster paced.  Personally, I'm enjoying LoL as an esport as much as ever right now.

Edit: a word."
527,"My money would be this being the main reason. I'm a tsm fan. I used to watch every lcs game. But now I only tune in to watch tsm because I can't stand any of the analysts. 

EU is just a way more interesting viewing experience and better league of legends in general."
528,"LEC is a million times better than LCS and that’s why I watch it. Idk what the hell LCS is doing but majority of personalities are extremely boring. They don’t produce any hype around players or teams. 

The best part of LCS is captain flowers and he can’t carry the dead weight that the stream is alone. Casters are good for LCS but damn the desk personalities sin markz are pretty shit. 

Seems like they are trying to cater to fortnite audience meanwhile the only way I can get through an LCS stream is watching it with doublelift sneaky and meteos."
529,"EU rebrand has been amazing. Everyone involved loves the game and takes it seriously and treats it as a professional. 

Meanwhile NA has Letigress in fucking jean jackets and stretch pants."
530,NA production definitely stepped up a lot this year. EU def is still better in a lot of ways but NA this year in production was much better than the past 2
531,NA production is very high quality. I just don't think it's all that interesting unfortunately.
532,"Say what you will about NA production, but the casters are still amazing esp Flowers."
533,100% on point.
534,"They have said that costreams are included in their viewer count.

But I agree. Great idea to place the big games like the *finals* on a timeslot that is unwatchable to the entirety of Europe. Half of the LEC viewers would absolutely have tuned in to see players like Abbe, Perkz and Alphari, but can't, because LCS decided that they didn't want European viewers. Really strange decision-making."
535,Yeah it used to be at 21
536,"And it's not just the co-streams, I don't know if casting may be a general issue or it's just something I personally don't like. 

I wouldn't know how to describe it, but I'd rather see Medic, Caedrel, Quickshot or Atlus, Wolf, Valdes than Kobe, Azael, Phreak (even though I've watched the playoffs and Phreak has done a great job, much much better than last year). Flowers is great though, I love when he's narrating.

I don't know, it may be that in LEC and LCK they don't over hype everything, though the LEC is from time to time guilty of this as well."
537,"the production does not contribute to the overall viewership of the game.

If the teams are good, and if the competition is perceived by us, the viewers are there, then people will watch. - The main contributor to viewership drop-off, is how we see our teams holistically compared to the rest of the world. If we start doing well at worlds, getting to the bo5 stage, that would drastically improve numbers."
538,"Yep, no rivalries, no repercussions, no loyalty, no NA players. Just boring."
539,"as a long time DL fan who's been looking for a new team or player to follow since DL retired:

Most of the top teams are just not people I want to be a fan of.

* Core is very admirable, but I hate that TL's personality is just ""we pay the most and are very serious"". Then all the shit with coaching making nuts roster swaps and benchings just left a bitter taste.

* I always loved watching G2 free style games, and I was hoping that would come to C9 with Perkz, but instead they just looked mentally fragile all year. This, plus the magic of OG C9 has just been gone since like 2015.

* TSM was kind of fun to watch because Spica, Huni, and POE are all super likeable. Also, they were definitely an underdog all year, but still made things competive, which is always fun. BUT jesus christ I wish Regi would just fuck off. Every time he opens his mouth shit just falls right out.

* I have mad respect for 100T breaking into the top teams of NA, but god damn do I just hate their branding from top to bottom.

* EG when its The Jiizuke Show is a blast to watch, I was starting to come around to them in the latter half of summer. They kind of imploded in playoffs though, so I guess I'll have to wait till next year to see how they develop."
540,It’s also just being shit though. I rarely care about league and only watch international stuff so I can see China and Korea style.
541,"EU LCS used to have terrible scheduling due to being under NA management, LEC is a new thing under EU management (and it shows)."
542,Part of this goes the other way to.  Not to say NA is a majority of the viewers but LEC isn't losing NA viewers
543,"I would argue that a huge issues is just people moving on. In NA games are more so trends than long stays  Halo, Starcraft, and many others have come and gone.   People just become disinterested that is no fault of Riot but the reality of the industry. People may argue well LoL is still in the top percentage of NA for streaming hours watched. I would say that is because personalities like Tyler1, DL, continue to play while their viewers watch for their personality."
544,">watching LCS players run it down for 30 minutes with a 25 minute pause in-between will kill ant viewership tbh

People say this as if they same shit doesn't occur in other regions all the same. Anytime (like this past weekend) LCS has a high kill bloodbath of a game, its a clown fiesta. Another region has the same game? Its a high speed aggressive game between two incredibly decisive teams. 

Slow game in the LCS? ""These guys aren't doing anything, so boring!"" Slow game anywhere else? ""Wow they are so calculated and are just starving out the opponent!"" 

Any time a team loses in the LCS, its the loser actually griefing and the winner isn't really that good. When a team loses in the LPL/LCK/LEC, the winner just played better."
545,"Phreak has gotten so much better as well. Azael? (Spelling) is alright. Dash is a legend on the desk and Emily is good.

Tbh I think its just the time between games that creates the distaste. Listening to analysts talk is okay, listening to them talk for like 10 minutes with two ad breaks inbetween is annoying.

Also a bit of a controversial take - TL is really talented, but their style of play has been boring for years. They have had a lot of screentime and peak viewership time because of how dominant they are. TL games have to turn casual fans away considering so much of the game is just vision control."
546,"Kobe Flower I cannot listen to. Flowers is just soulless hyping, like, playing a piano constantly slamming the keys and holding pedal. It doesn't work. Also his knowledge of the game is sub par.

I like post CLG breakdown Phreak, he's speaking his mind which is something the NA broadcast is lacking. Jatt is nice on next level. This or That used to be my favourite content, nowadays at best I'm watching the slides, I don't feel like they have anything interesting to say about the topics.

I'm not saying I could cast better than the NA staff, far from it. But to watch a cast they need to either hype (but in a way it's actually hype), or add information I didn't know before. LS stream has no hype, but gives a lot of info, LEC gives a ton of hype and some information, but NA... I'm a measly top6% player and I feel I understand more than they communicate on broadcast, so it's absolutely obsolete to listen to.

Nowadays I just chill with friends on discord and we comment on the games ourselves. I feel the level on insight is a lot higher."
547,COVID affected the entire world tho.
548,"Can confirm. As a NA, I did not watch the LCS finals, but watched the LCK finals."
549,"There is a lot of ways to hype a TL vs 100T Bo5 even tho yes LCS isnt the best region in the world.

The problem doesnt lie in the actual teams playing in NA but how the broadcast work around that material.

EU used to be considered as the boring region a few seasons ago basicaly (before the franchising if I remember correctly) and then they did a 180 on the way they communicate, hype matches and to some degree casts those games. And it produced results before the rise of europe as a top 2 region in terms of team skills.

LCS dropped the ball but it's up to them to be back in form."
550,"Not really. LCK is probably the weakest it's been since 2018. People here just eat up shitty names and org names.

LCK still plays extremely scared. 

Top 2 LEC and LCK are about the same outside of Damwon being slightly ahead. And the 3 LCS teams are around Rogues level. A little worse but generally the same dog shit."
551,"Well, I am a 100T/DIG fan and I have noticed every time I turn on youtube my team just aced or beat up. 

So I decided to basically go take my children to the park during the finals...and well, 100T made history :D"
552,"Lol is also just infinitely more popular in Korea and China than in NA. The average person here couldnt name a Lol team much less a player, whereas in China/Korea it seems (someone can correct me if im wrong) that Lol Esports is just as big if not bigger than regular sports."
553,"There was another series available though. TSM vs C9. The two most popular orgs, went to game 5 and while it wasn't the final, the stakes were just as high because of Worlds qualification.

G2 vs Fnatic was LEC's most popular after all, and that was only round 3 of 5."
554,Never heard more COPIUM in my life.
555,"Whats also annoying for me as an EU viewer is how irrelevent these constant ads are for me. I will never get insurance from Statefarm, buy a Bud light or a jersey mikes sandwich....because I literally can't. At the same time, NA viewers can buy Redbull, Kitkat, Alienware PCs, Logitech stuff or a Kia."
556,"During finals I got burritos with a friend between games (took probably 20 minutes), came back and champ select had just started. Sometimes the break is nice for things like that tbh but would definitely prefer a faster pace."
557,"LCS has the addition of in-game ads and shoutouts non-stop. I also think the biggest difference is that LEC produces a lot of their product ads. LEC reminds me of a small acting troupe, so while it's no HBO quality, at least it's better the same Jake from State Farm and RedBull ads for 4 years.

Edit: Except for that absolutely horrendous Kit-Kat ""Elo Hell"" ad. I dID iT. I Did iT. wE dID iT. That's in LEC too."
558,The breaks between games seem so much longer in LCS than in LEC. I don't know if it's actually like that or if it just feels like it.
559,In NA they are way longer. In EU they stick to the time slots and fill the gaps. In NA they run over the time slots by having really long as breaks and analysis sections.
560,"Nah, Dash is better than Sjokz. He's held back by production."
561,">difference between NA and EU casters is staggering

agreed, only reason to watch NA half the time is how much better their casters are"
562,The analyst desk for the most part is straight bad imo and given their low quality they have way too much air time.
563,"i don't think they need new people...they have talent on their team. most of the casters are pretty good. some of the analysts are pretty good.

but they absolutely need a revamp. the LEC team knows their audience and what they want. their music videos, hype videos, comedic bits before and after the show all fit well with their audience and they have a variety of guests for analysis between games.

the LCS is making good content like Next Level and Replay Files, but it's not really ""broadcast"" content it's just a youtube video they play before the games. and they have their podcasts and other shows but it still feels like ""hey go watch this other stuff"" and not ""this other stuff is designed to bring you to the broadcast"""
564,They keep bringing in fresh faces and it doesn't fix anything.
565,">Major revamp of brand and content

Literally did a brand refresh and have been doing different types of content this year. 

>bring in fresh faces to add more personality.

They brought in several new faces this year. Most people aren't giving them a chance to settle in. 

>I miss Jatt 

I love Jatt but the irony of asking for new faces then asking for Jatt back is funny to me.

LCS's problems aren't with production. Its because LCS has no stakes once regional competition ends. Everyone knows they won't make noise at Worlds or MSI. LEC got huge, not because of the production team, because FNC and G2 made finals and actually have a shot at Worlds now."
566,"Hey, they brought him in for that absolutely absurd Grubhub ad."
567,"Well they did bring in fresh faces like Kaizen, and I'm honestly not a fan. I think the existing on air talent is great, but that might just be because I've been watching them for so many years now."
568,Jatts stats Rest In Peace
569,"I meant that as a shoutout. I should have phrased that better. Others are great too like Emily, Raz, Azael and Phreak."
570,"Flowers, Phreak, Kobe, Dash, Raz, Azael all great imo."
571,"I like the main caster on the desk, the one who did it the whole playoffs. I don’t know his name though."
572,Losing the actually talented and interesting personalities like Ovilee sure as fuck doesnt help.
573,Azael is pretty bad too. Really cringe persona
574,I think the primary fault lies with the higher ups behind the scene rather than the broadcast talent. Quickshot really stepped up and became a leader for the LEC. LCS really needed someone to become the new leader.
575,"I guess its more to do with players, teams, and broadcast not advertising or I guess selling the players to the fans then. Its so hard to tell what their personalities are like. Like I didnt know Ignar was a car person until an interview with Travis, which made me like him more."
576,I went from playing league regularly and watching all lcs games to not playing league anymore and only watching playoffs. After bjergsen and doublelift retired I just started playing valorant and following the competitive scene there. It's nice cheering for a winning region where the best team is comprised of all na players.
577,"The difference is there was always hope for teams.  Early on it was because we hadn't really had big international tournaments where literally all the best teams got together so despite expert predictions we were still hopeful.  Then It was because C9 and TSM were considered competitive, and ""unlucky"" where a lot of times either people felt they underperformed or got unlucky with a draw.  Same for TL for a bit, but when those teams failed and you had 2 years in a row where NA fails to make it out of groups you see what happens, people lose hope.  

I don't think it has anything to do with NA players not being on the top teams.  If having NA players mattered then why don't more people watch the lower teams who have more NA players.  Why wasn't Golden Guardians the most popular team in the league when they had a full roster of NA talent.  It's because people want success and competition.  If you put the top 3 Korean rosters on TL, C9 and TSM I promise you NA's popularity would skyrocket."
578,">there are 0 native NA players in the top team.

uhhhm, actually there's 3

Edit: I read it wrong, u right"
579,"You leave cp. Flowers and phreak out of this , these mfs have their spines shattered of how hard they are carrying LCS"
580,"Support facechecks bush

*Camera pans to show Xinzhao E-Q1 into Gnar hop away*

Support dies"
581,"hell, if you wanna watch how they path you can just watch the minimap. The only thing jungler focus really shows is how good they are at PvE'ing, kiting camps together, that sort of thing."
582,it's 2021 and observers are still following junglers around level 1-6.
583,Alphari as well has been trying to build a brand and you can see fudge is trying to do that villain person. The lcs broadcast is just shutting it down.
584,"I don't think that people can't root for new faces.

I used to watch every single game up until this year, and right now, i have to go to the wikis to see who plays for what team because they play musical chairs every year.

When a player gets hype behind them they get replaced/shit on because the team that made them work gets revamped.

And to top it off, LCS used to be extremely boring in-between games, don't know now because the 1-2h gap between LEC and LCS gets my hype for pro lol games to die down.

All in all, the lack luster track record and show just catched up to them."
585,Players are trying but between the production not letting them and fans just refusing to care while making assumptions without watching its not working. There is much crowd sourced bad opinion that gets thrown at LCS ( in addition to the bad stuff LCS does have ) it just keeps snowballing hate. Wrong or rightly deserved.
586,Oh fk off :D treatz an na reject that failed to make playoffs spent nearly all of eu play offs on the desk. Which is a huge thing for any less know player
587,"They get curb stomped internally. The team comps, drafts and poor team fighting or lack of fighting from teams in LCS is laughable. I like games with top teams but most games are just not it. The gameplay sucks."
588,"Brazil isn't good internationally, but CBLOL viewership is steadily growing and has matched/exceeded LCS at this point."
589,"Making finals at Worlds in 2018 & 2019 probably did help viewership, but the LEC has also been putting out great shows since franchising in 2019. It's probably a bit of both.

*Edit* -- and it's not like EU didn't make semi-finals at Worlds 4x between 2012 and 2016. Making finals is better, but EU did well enough internationally before."
590,"But that's revisionism.

You transform multiples reasons into one. I'm not even sure it's the main one.

For me, one of the biggest reason is that EU production became independent meaning: way better schedule linked to its viewership, complete revamp of the format / content creation (tone completly changed, fresh UI, caster having real fun live) and the focus being put on local talents with the success of the EU master formula.

**TLDR: Having a great product catering to the fan of your region while celebrate local talent is the key to success. International result are just extras**"
591,"I'm not so sure, for the longest time LPL was at least the second best league in the world and the english viewership for example was piss poor. Argument at the time given by many people who didnt watch was that the ""broadcast wasn't entertaining enough"". To be fair, in comparison to EU/NA they were a fair way behind, albeit that itself was a limitation set by them being a piggyback broadcast off the main CN stream. LCK outperformed by being the best league and having the good fortune of OGN allowing Monte/Doa and then later Papa etc. to interact a lot (relative) with the KR team giving us beautiful moments like wtf 2 shens. Even now this is somethign the LPL-En team struggles with, they do an admirable job of covering the inherent flaw of not having cohesive control of the broadcast, but there is only so much you can do.  


And now even the [LCK](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lck-2021-summer) is outperforming the [LCS](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lcs-2021-summer), [LPL](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lpl-2021-summer) is still half but honestly I don't know if that's something to look at and think it's good. The entertainment product that is the LCS is just not as good. It's stiff and the personalities often seem to blend into each other. This isn't to say the on-screen talent isn't ""good enough"", the entire team is incredibly good at what they do it just feels like their ""design philosophy"" is off."
592,">TLDR: Being actually good on the big stage is what you get fans and viewership, everything else is just extras 

Hard disagree. Timezone problems are the biggest issue and its not even close"
593,G2 is great at bantering. When they suck it's disrespectful (Wunder's yuumi lol) but when they're good it's entertaining. I remember the vacation memes.
594,"Nah man, I think there are at least like 10 more important reasons why LCS isnt great right now. Not saying it can't be the most important factor for some people, but gerally speaking i think that lack of good narratives, bad start time for EU, terrible regular season Format, long breaks between games, low overall gameplay quality etc are bigger issues. Personality wise the league is carried by Perkz, Core and Alphari - all of the are imports..."
595,"I've supported FNC in EU and CLG in NA. FNC even at their lowest, was only one year and they still gave their best trying to win. 

Now why would I tune in to watch LCS at 3 am when the only team I like has been a huge disappointment for 5 years straight?"
596,"On the flip side, I stopped watching LEC because every time I found a team to like the roster would change and bring in players that I disliked. I got tired of trying to find and EU team to root for."
597,"We lost Alphari and Perkz just this year. NA keeps taking some of EU's best players. But I do think there are some other players, like Caps, who won't even consider NA because they know that they actually have a chance internationally if they stay in EU. But if they go to NA then they know they won't do anything internationally."
598,I was up until random benchings
599,I was gunning big time for DIG this year. I just want something like a return to the old Fnatic C9 rivalry where it was 5 NA versus 5 EU and the shittalking before during and after the game was amazing.
600,My donger was raised this year!
601,Funnily enough i actually saw (eye test) a decent amount of interest in Dig especially when they had their initial rise in standings. Sure it wasnt TSM/C9/TL levels but still outperforming the engegement per dolar/import  from other teams.
602,">Doesn't this go exactly against your earlier diatribe? Like you were   
just bitching about how the top 4 teams have only 4 NA players   
(including 100T in there) butyou're saying that the imports just collect a fat check and lose?

Not at all. ""Lose"" in the context of international competition. So NA teams are largely achieving the same results domestically and internationally. Sure, 100T won this split, but 3 of the top 4 teams were still the perennial powerhouses. 

So the results are nearly identical, but now NA teams are paying 10x the price for those same mediocre results. 

I would still rather watch shitty NA talent go against each other than watch imports come here and replicate the same results domestically and internationally."
603,sadly they got 2nd so he won't get to stomp playins for clout
604,"In a bo5, breaks for 15-20 min are fine. They need time to strategies for the next game and give the players time to rest."
605,"Games can't start before the announced time, they can start after though. If you announce a game time, then start it early people are going to miss their team when they come in and its 15 mins into the game. They just need to stop going over start times."
606,">They didn’t step up production. Production is the worst it’s ever been by far and it’s not even close.

Sorry but you do not sound like someone who watched LCS last year.  

Anyway you're clearly just a troll who's downvote farming so I'm not even going to try to argue with you besides this one comment. Have a nice day man."
607,"I share the same sentiment i remember looking into it what would happen if eu didnt send anyone to na and what we got was a stacked rosters. 

I mean midlane wouldve been caps,perkz,humanoid,bjergsen,nisqy,larssen,jensen,poe,jizuke, vetheo,abbedagge  <- and thats 11.

Imagine being a rookie and trying to stand out among those names."
608,"While this is obviously true, with the way the LCS is EU slowly gets more and more slots for worlds."
609,You're not gonna get downvoted
610,Why pair the LCK with the LEC? The LCK/OGN never had trouble winning things even when being imported from every region.
611,The level of skill would be higher for LEC and LCK but it would be bad for the scene as a whole.
612,Not the entire comment chain ignoring the piles of ad and sponsor funding LCS injects into proplay.
613,"Why doesn’t NA include the LLA? Like I don’t get why EU gets 100 countries (exaggerating) of talent with various languages, and NA gets USA and Canada. The game isn’t thriving in either of those countries anymore."
614,"> Imports in theory should increase viewership

Why in theory? You may get a few foreign viewers but there's a reason why people tend to rally behind athletes from their city/country in sports competitions."
615,As someone who watches nba/nfl imo to the American audience that really doesn't make much a difference. Everything is sponsored here.
616,"This is honestly pretty normal in the U.S. Personally it still makes me happy to see the league being supported by these sponsors, so it doesn't really bother me, but I can understand how it can be annoying"
617,Are you trolling or just ignoring the fact that the LEC also shows their sponsors during games and in between games?

627,You were so bothered by 3 letters that you closer the stream? I can't for the life of me understand how people are so affected by these sponsorships.
628,"Goodness the high horse here is 10 stories tall. Sponsors make the league money, point blank. It’s a business decision, you don’t have to like it but a failure to understand it, based entirely on your own perspective, is ignorant. If you’re so distracted by a 5 second sponsor mention on an 8 hour stream that directly supports the product you’re watching, for free* mind you, I don’t know what to tell you. 

*free barring cost of internet access in the first place."
629,"The annoying part is that they have all these ads in game, and also have like 10 min of ads total between games. Definitely a big factor in my decreased viewership at least"
630,"I havent watched LCS since I heard Phreak utter the phrase, ""Bud Light Ace,"" during a match.

In game ad call outs during the cast are beyond obnoxious.  Even American legacy sports are smart enough to not implement a ""Taco Bell Touchdown"" or a ""State Farm Safety"""
631,Pornhub base race
632,"I actually think bud light ace sounds decent and let's be honest it isn't a routinely announced one, it's game state dependent."
633,"What do you mean with looking for it in other Leagues.  
Plenty of casters will mention the gold difference, there is also graphics popping up from time to time showing the gold difference or baron gold swing and if not just compare the gold numbers from both teams."
634,"It's not the gold advantage that's the problem, it's the FTX part. In Europe we don't put sponsor names before everything (talking traditional sports, pretty sure we have baron power play too?). I only watch restreams of LCS because official cast is just an endless litany of brands that evzn captain flowers' hype can't make me forget"
635,Is the NA education system so bad you can’t mentally subtract to 5-digit numbers?
636,"It's not useful at all, you can do some quick mental subtraction and find out how far any team is ahead at any point in the game, since the total gold of both teams is always shown, FTX Gold Advantage™ is literally a subtraction. Baron power play is useful because it tells you how the gold advantage swings only during baron buff's duration, making you appreciate a team's use of it better, if it told you the gold difference between teams at all times, it would be totally useless too."
637,R u trying to imply emily and primal are the reason? xD?

642,"LCK and LPL play way more games and have way better viewership. It's not the format, although I agree the format doesn't do any favors for viewership."
643,"your just grasping at straws at this point trying to defend it. if the format is so good then why won't lck/lpl or lec do it? its just bad and allows for teams to fuck around because there aren't any stakes hell T1 did the same roster change in the middle of their summer  split and did good. Its certainly not helping viewership might as well just copy lck format and make a b03 for each game.

sorry if i might sound rude english isn't my 1st language but I just hate this format it isn't helping competition nor helping in viewers."
644,"Ok, and what is the problem with spring meaning nothing but MSI ? Do you think its better that Summer means nothing ? Cause that is what happens, the regular season in summer means nothing almost.

GGS made playoffs ... ok and ? Who cares that they made playoffs ? What do you get out of it ? 8 of 10 make playoffs, its irrelevant, they got 3-0ed, what an achievement, especially when half the teams didn't give a shit and where making random substitutions and all that shit, how hard is it to make playoffs ? Its much harder not to make playoffs then to make it, so if anything it says more about the teams beneath them then about them. Playoffs with 41% winrate in summer....


>Sure, C9/TL could lose 70% of their games, but then they would lose the massive advantage of 3-6 or 1-2 and be forced to win 4-5 Bo5s for Worlds/Title. Any team that fucks around that long is likely not going to be building good fundamentals coming into playoffs.


Yeah man, such a massive advantage when you know you're the better team. How hard did that affect TL ? I mean everyone was talking about their shit record vs the top teams during regular split, and then what ? First bo5 and everyone thinks they're favorites...Yeah they didn't win, but they made finals. TSM was first and they didn't make it, EG was third and failed hard, seeding doesn't really matter when you're the better team and coasting all season. 

Hell, often times, especially if you have issues, more bo5s can be a good thing, since it is amazing practice. Look at FNC who ended the regular split in poor form, they got better with each bo5 and, whilst they didn't win the final, no one expected that deep run at the start of playoffs. 

>having 2 extra teams just means there are 2 extra Bo5s, who cares at that point, just don't watch them if you don't want to.

Ok ? and that's what happened, people didn't watch, just like they didn't watch in the regular split... too many games and too few of them mattering. That is the whole point of this conversation, that fewer people watched then in the past."
645,Are there any drops better than hextech chests usually?
646,"they can't foster an underdog image with State Farm Analyst Desk and FTX Gold Diff assaulting your eyes while Nadeshot is off-camera selling overpriced hoodies out of his $100 million compound for his team that features a single NA player. who is going to believe TSM is an underdog when they are constantly talking about how much money their sponsors give them? they are all perennial underachievers, not underdogs."
647,">Most of the imports have stuck around for a while and have connected with the fans and made an effort to improve the league e.g. CoreJJ

CoreJJ is an exception, not the norm. Most of the imports have not connected with the fans and made 0 efforts to improve the League.

The biggest travesty is Huni. He was EU LCS #1 love child with his bubbly personality and humor. He became invisible when he move to NA. Sucked into a vortex of players too lazy to connect with fans and having 0 screen time thanks to LCS production team."

656,There can be multiple reasons you know
657,People don't care about personality more than they care about winning. You are out of your mind if you don't think NA making deep runs in tournaments on the regular wouldn't drastically increase the viewership.
658,"How many people watch LCS or pro league for production 

The reason is simple: line up when LCS started to decline (2017-2018) and it’s no coincidence it’s around the same time the perception of the region as a weak major was accelerated 

It’s that simple. Bring G2 and FNC into this league and let’s see how many viewers it gets…

Only small amount of maybe vocal people give a single fuck about production or narrative or whatever… narratives are made when you have something to base them off of

What do you want them to make a narrative of? Spica the god MVP carried TSM to playoffs!!?! Wow!!!! Come watch him play!!!

Ya no one cares"
659,"Me too bro. I love watching American football and the NBA for those POGO production quality. If the analyst desk sucks or the commercials arent for me I'd rather skip the actual game itself. Heck no I watch basketball for LeBron vs 72 win Golden State Warriors. Who the F cares about ""personalities"". Notice how personalities tend to shine more once they produce real international results? 

What's ironic is yours is the copium take at all. Esports fans watch the games for hype and it's been nonexistent since NA is literally 0-11 at worlds now. They made semifinals what like 2-4x? Each time they get devoured by a swept or it's 3-1 at best. LEC deserves more views alone just from international success."
660,Why is it the productions responsibility to create personalities. That’s the team and players jobs.
661,"When did i say it was the only problem? All i'm saying is that it doesn't hurt to not be called a meme region, a retirement home, etc. There are multiple reaaons why LCS is losing viewers and i can guarentee that level of play is one of them"
662,"Maybe they dont succeed at personalities, but they really try to force player narratives with the way they discuss things. The players dont have h2h history though so its difficult to really build narratives with that turnover."
663,If NA made a convincing run to semi’s that didn’t look like they just coinflipped a series viewership would certainly skyrocket. If there was any belief that NA has a legitimate chance to win worlds in the future the hype would make people want to watch the league. There’s other problems as well but performance is 80% of the problem
664,"You get memorable by being good at the game, as someone who watches LoL esports since 2013 the only reason LEC got popular as it did is because of the international succes."
665,Clearly not working if its declined
666,And that is actively hurting their viewer numbers instead.
667,No he is right. They will go 2-4 in groups at best. No chance of making it out.
668,C9 vs afreeca was only 3 years ago and 2 years ago TL had a shot at getting out of groups against Damwon and IG. Similarly TL and Fly finished 1 win away from getting out of hard groups last year. Only TSM really rolled over and died along with rogue who finished behind a wildcard team.
669,"I mean, it's in NA's name ' N(near) A(airport) the writing has been on the wall.  Just like our motto here in the good ole' US ' Land of the Free'"
670,"I agree with some of your points. I don’t think their casting is necessarily bad but I do think the level of analysis is subpar. Sometimes they’ll say things that don’t even make sense or have zero justification for. I remember one time the casters were going on about which team had more scaling and it was literally analysis any gold/silver player could’ve just blurted out. There was nothing special about the analysis, zero substance. 

I think the play by play casting is decent. I have no problem with it. It’s the quality of the analysis that I think is very mediocre. Most times it’s just random guessing and majority of the time, the analysis is so off that it’s off putting.

Another example is when the casters spend like 2 minutes trying to explain why the pro player fucked up (maybe didn’t auto for an extra plate), but in reality don’t clearly understand why the player did what he did. Again, the analysis is so surface level and any person could’ve said that."
671,"Ya there's def not enough new blood coming into the scene both on the actual league side and the fan side. For us old heads, the players we grew up watching gradually went away and retired. Voyboy, dyrus, Saint, bjerg, dl, sneaky, froggen, qt all gone now it's hard to get attached to new players when I'm constantly looking nostalgically at the past. Having new people watch the game would mean they would get interested in the new players and drive the hype but rn it's just a bunch of boomers watching longing for the good ol days of wild west league"
672,"You are right! Like damn, you aren't Football. Be League of Legends. I don't watch you for your sports presentation. It's like they hired the same director as the NBA/NFL.  


Give me humor and memes and some cool original shit. More homegrown talent would be nice too but NA retirement home is a thing that will never change no matter how poorly we do in Worlds year in, year out."
673,Idk what hes saying raz hai and emily are great additions with a lot of background to the game. Not to mention primal and letrigress being charming as well.
674,"I'mna be real with you chief, I'm not staying up until 2AM to watch Lost and PowerOfEvil."
675,"Games that go the distance in NA means that EU people go to sleep, it is hard for NA games to have high peaks"
676,The was the shriveled corpse of teams wearing the colors of C9 and TSM but the closest thing to an actual tsm or c9 player was tsm's coach
677,">For a comparison, g2 vs fnc peaked as second most viewed playoffs at 860k + I'm pretty sure it had less views than the eventual finals.

[Escharts says G2 v FNC was the highest this playoffs.](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lec-summer-2021)"
678,"Not saying there is not something wrong with LCS, but IMO most of people know getting to worlds doesn’t matter as there will be a speed run again. 

So LCS trophy is something they could have at least won."
679,"yeah, time of their games. when they started at like 10pm cet we could watch a few games. now they start at 12am cet. or more like 12.30 am. cause when it says, a certain match starts at 12am, they mean preshow starts at 12am"
680,LCS has 50% more broadcast time than LEC though. you dont understand how viewership works if you think that isn't an important fact that everyone ignores.
681,"Lol. So is there some other place where EU fans discuss the game? 

Give me a reason why viewership would not correlate to subreddit presence at all. And they have a bigger playerbase too.

EU related threads do way better too. Whether it’s interviews, hype videos, or highlights. 

If way more people are tuning into the ENGLISH LEC broadcast, and Reddit is the only real place to discuss postgame - is there some reason EU fans are less inclined to want to discuss the game? “Not EVERYONE uses Reddit”. Yeah, but a percent do, so that’s just an idiotic comment,

Lmao, EU fans will use any excuse to say there isn’t EU bias on Reddit even though anyone with a single eyeball can see it."
682,"I'm not sure how directed LeTigress is in terms of what she asks during interviews but I do think Ovilee was a better fit for the community even if again people thought some of her questions were cringe. I think LCS at some point decided to go more of a traditional sports route in their presentation (maybe because advertisers are more familiar with this format/presentation) which is when LeTigress came on the team and I think she is pretty professional and well-presented. I'm worried that if LCS continues to straddle this line between traditional presentation and still trying to be relatable to the Twitch/League audience, that the production will continue to suffer and they'll lose their audience and sponsors in that order."
683,Damn my scanner eyes missed it then. Well then that sucks
684,"I'd call Huhi is an immigrant not an import. He' showed even as far back as his CLG days that he'd assimilated into American culture.

I think 100T is a great example of the difference because if you compare Ssumday and Huhi, Ssumday is culturally a Korean living in America, while Huhi is culturally Korean-American. If Ssumday got injured and was unable to play League ever again, I'd imagine he'd move back to Korea, while Huhi would stay in America (if he legally could).

That said, assimilating into a culture is not easy. I'm a Californian who's lived in Texas for 4 years and even I haven't fully assimilated to the local culture. I definitely do not fault Ssumday not having done it. But it also keeps him an import in my mind.

I don't pay as much attention to the scene anymore though, so I could be wrong, maybe he's more American than I know at this point."
685,"Completly agree with you ! But to me it gets to a point where I am thinking that they have to do this because they don't know anythingelse. 

Ps: I am not saying this to brag but peaked challenger and reached master on every role. I aspire to be a professional coach or analyst and sometimes they will bash on a player for literally minutes after a play he made but they don't understand why he made the play in the first place which seems like an int but the player clearly had something in mind the analyst didn't see. It's fine when it's a color caster but not when an analyst makes that mistake. I am often thinking about Azael for this lol. Also Raz has absolutely no idea how the game works.  

Ps2: don't know why I shared so much but I loved your take
 I think some of them could keep their job if we had a good production team and someone to work with analysts on how to be analyzing and not judging per say. I don't think it's easy by any means but something has to change for all of them IMO."
686,"I mean they're definitely not going to feel good, but at the same time the value of a single viewer is not necessarily the same across leagues. I would imagine that LCS has an older viewerbase on average and more valuable viewers to many of their sponsors. For example, 4 or 5 years ago, I'd imagine that even with the same or more viewers, there would still be fewer viewers able to legally purchase beer (Bud Light) or in the market for a new car (Honda). Whereas, I'm now 22/23 (turned 23 in August), and can obviously buy beer and just bought a new car (wasn't a Honda, but that's besides the point). And I'm not the only one. League in NA exploded in popularity among high schoolers/middle schoolers starting 5 or 6 years ago so many of those players are now the ones still watching LCS and are now in college or just entered the workforce full-time."
687,"From what Monte said, for these LCS teams with massive roster salaries it's basically a failure (from a sponsorship perspective) if they don't make it to Worlds. Makes sense with how shit LCS viewership numbers are too."
688,"Hasn’t CBLOL always had great viewership for a minor region? Cause if they kept their audience while NA continued to mess up in terms of talent and production value, it makes sense for Brazil to surpass us in terms of viewers"
689,if you think about it\`s not even academy as that would be sort of EU masters. French national league could be described as tier 3
690,"I mean no disrespect, but it is essentially a French minor league that many go to with aspirations to play in LEC, the major league. Academy might not be the right word for it but it's essentially correct"
691,Maybe he was calling NA the academy.
692,It is still crazy that a country has as much viewership as a major region
693,Proves they didn't even read the article since it mentions that specifically
694,Seven NA teams probably.
695,"That is my biggest problem with how LEC and LCS are done, why the fuck they have that 3 minutes completely wasted? Put your ads there or try to sell the spot for ads.

I don't know ahit about broadcasting but to me it feel like wasted time"
696,It's for the ads on the streaming platforms. You will notice even LEC does this so idk why you think any other production would be different.
697,"Yeah LPL is the best, but I can never call myself a fan of an eastern team. Come Worlds I will always support the West, but with the way NA is at the moment, I can't even find an NA team I would be a fan of."
698,Based take
699,"You do realize that most of the time the English stream of LPL isn't fully live right? That's why there's less breaks as often the second series will start before the first series finishes since they're played in different cities across China. This allows them to have less breaks included, but other leagues don't have the same luxury."
700,"I don't understand why anyone would watch the broadcasts live. Regardless of whether the production is good or bad, I don't want to see anything other than the games. I watch pretty much every LCS game and the international tournaments, and I don't think I've ever tuned in live. I start the vods at champ select and turn it off immediately after the nexus explodes. They could have the best, most interesting analysts in the world and it's not going to make me give a shit about their opinions or predictions."
701,"i honestly can't enjoy the casters too much after all the comments about Nuguri during FPX-RNG. just constantly bringing up that he was a transfer and just that same bullshit over and over. just made it feel that they didn't want Nuguri in the region more than anything. rewatching game 4 of that series, so many of his deaths are highlighted with some kind of comment about his residency.

i love the LPL, but for all the hype people give the casting, i just felt they spewed too much narrative, especially regarding their second best team. narrative is fine, but it just overflows in LPL and sometimes overshadows the game itself.

not saying they're terrible and that no one can enjoy them. for all the calls i dislike, there are plenty that are great. just that same game alone had Tian being killed on Hecarim referred to as being sent to the glue factory."
702,based
703,I’ll usually catch the good LEC games while playing some other video game then only bother to try and catch the CLG games (pain) because of our stupid time slot
704,"For me on the west coast it sucks cus its right in the middle of the day and I want to do things during the middle of the day on a weekend,  or I have work.  So I watch vods 90% of the time.  So I'd prefer it start earlier or later"
705,Well thats why I dont watch the LPL. I would love to but matches start at 5:00am and thats not happening
706,"As a student in EU who currently only has Zoom school LCK is perfect timing for me at 10am, it lets me watch the games before class or during breaks.   


Another thing is LCK/League has a strong presence at home in Korea, and so the timeslot doesn't require them hitting multiple regions for good viewership numbers.  NA doesn't have that same level of home viewership and relies more on other regions than LCK."
707,"That’s me here. I usually tune into lck/lpl on my second monitor while working. At the same time I can’t be bothered anymore to watch LCS at like 1 A.M.

I want to watch lcs, I really do. But the schedule makes it very hard"
708,But it still makes the same big numbers even in spring split when most people are either at work or school at 9am in the morning
709,"Yeah but I never watched NA for peak gameplay lol. It was just fun and had some 2000s vibes in the early days. It was just random guys like Doublelift, Dyrus, IWD who made it big and it also felt a lot like a tight community. Losing these old guard players surely didn't help NA."
710,"Costreams have taken the role of old analyst desk, actually (critically) analysing the games, current postgames are just meaningless replays."
711,"I don’t know if expecting the analyst desk to teach you anything is fair. In traditional sports the analyst desks do the same thing: talk through the big plays. Rarely any novel information is shared. Occasionally the analysts notice something about the play that I hadn’t maybe. But also in traditional sports no one watches the AD. That’s when u go get a snack or do anything else. The desk is just meant to fill dead air as best they can. 
I think we can all agree, though, that shrinking the time between games as much as possible would be good."
712,"Honestly the production is half the reason I watch the LEC. I am not super into league anymore, but the storylines and continual fun antics by the production keeps me coming back week after week. 

""Reckless with my heart"" has even ended up on my music playlist."
713,"Yeah, the biggest thing I like about the LEC is the production quality."
714,"NA waiting room was a meme for a reason

EU used to be right before NA so whenever EU was delayed due to whatever reasons then the NA fans had to wait

franchising was incredibly successful but it wouldnt have been nowhere near as successful had EU not shifted towards a more ""player first"" kind of light hearted style which sjokz was just incredible skilled at bringing these players on the analyst desk to build them up and get the fans invested

to this day i still remember the numerous hilarious moments of Perkz, Febiven, Caps, jankos and Maxlore segments which contained this [legendary trashtalk](https://clips.twitch.tv/BumblingDeterminedOysterPRChase)

also these highly informational [""procasts""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WZg9kEIERY)"
715,"Exact same for me. Between friends, the girlfriend and playing some games myself i rarely have time to watch all the games live. But I'll catch up throughout the week using vods. And i loved both lcs and lec in terms of teams, how close playoffs were and how much fun it was to watch."
716,I love Sjokz and Dash they’re both great to watch
717,"Personally I think it’s garbage. The scoreboard UI is terrible, FTX gold advantage is a useless stat and adds clutter.

Also the fact that they had crumbz, letigress and a fucking VTUBER as a segment really makes me never want to watch LCS. I can just about handle crumbz but dear god this combination encapsulates everything I hate about LCS"
718,"For sponsors who pay good money to advertise to an NA audience, EU views add zero value. So I'm guessing that Riot decided to tweak schedules in a way that maximizes NA views even if it means it's bad hours for EU."
719,Maybe dare I say Counter Logic?
720,"> because LCS decided that they didn't want European viewers. Really strange decision-making.

It's inflating the viewership, europeans doesnt count towards the LCS sponsors that put their commercial, maybe with better times for EU viewiers it would lower the number of people watching in NA?"
721,they did their finals right after lec...when else are they going to do it? push the whole production back by a week when they're already the last people to host their finals?
722,Yeah because EU got fucked over with its schedule.
723,"If you'd rather see Wolf than Kobe, Azael, or Phreak, you're on some drugs my guy. Wolf is probably one of the worst color casters in the four major regions currently and just says outright wrong stuff way too often."
724,"I think Kobe, Phreak, Azael, Flowers, Dash, Emily and Hai are great. I couldn not care else about the others tho.

I think Pastry is better off as an off-air talent. His replay files stuff is great, I love listening to him. His on-air stuff just goes in one ear and right out the other."
725,"Imo LCS has 4 really good casters (Azael, Kobe, Phreak and Flowers) and the rest are kinda boring to me. Their analyst desk is hit or miss, sometimes really good, sometimes super messy. I found this season Dash was not controlling his desk as well as he used to do, and we had many more ""shouting contest"" sections where the are just shouting jokes to each other and it's not particularly interesting. I also think it's time Crumbz and Markz take a step forward and up their game because their own thing is getting a bit stale. 

LEC has some issues but has really done a good job with creating interesting on air personalities. Also I will never give enough credit to Quickshot to enable the environment the LEC is in - and it also happens that he is a very, very good caster."
726,"LEC does overhype things though? Old old kings vs new old kings, etc"
727,As a European I closed the LCS broadcast numerous times when they started talking about redbull barons bud light aces and statefarm analyst desk. Not because the gameplay is ass. That's the whole reason anyone would watch LCS anyway...
728,"This is wrong.

I'm North American and enjoy watching LEC more than LCS, in a significant part due to the production. Casters are mostly better, observer is better, analysts are better.

LCS almost sounds like a parody where you can have 6 sponsors spoken in the same sentence. ""This mastercard gold graph showing the fpx gold advantage has a big turn due to the red bull baron power play after the bud light ace. Let's turn it to our state farm analyst desk to break it down.

It's sickening. Actively makes me care less about lcs."
729,"Even though I don’t like him, this is why I think Jizuke is good for the NA scene. Dude would straight up call out guys on other teams before big series. He’s a cocky player on and off the rift which is exciting in some ways"
730,"Ironically; CLG is the reason I watch the LCS.

Seeing how hilariously bad they are [And hearing casters despair] is hilarious. It's a 'so bad it's good'."
731,"Im sure theres some crossover for sure. Id love to see the actual demographics tbh.

The biggest thing that hurt EU viewership in the past was the terrible scheduling. Was like Thursday and friday with games starting at like 3/4pm here in the UK. Time you got home from work there would only be a couple of games left and then straight into LCS"
732,"It's also the streaming culture and that big streamers move from game to game for whatever game is hot right now. From Fortnite, Apex, Fall Guys, Valorant, Among us, many of these are often somehow associated with some big NA streamer like Ninja, Dr. Lupo, Shroud, Timthetatman, Courage, etc. The kids who watch these probably follow them often from game to game, while younger people in EU maybe are not that fluent in english yet and prioritize what their friends play over streamers."
733,LEC viewership was down from spring too - it’s not just an LCS thing.
734,based
735,"I'm kinda blessed in the sense that I live in NA but work overnight at a job that allows us to use tablets and stuff when it's slow/quiet,

So I was able to watch LCK and LEC finals easily, will probably be able to watch LPL. NA is actually the hardest one for me to watch without sacrificing sleep"
736,First game started at 2:30 am PST too btw
737,"Yo man same boat, I fucking woke up at 3AM to watch the finals. Do you think I'd have that dedication to watch any NA team? Hell no.


I mean Tbf, I wouldn't even wake up at 4 for G2 v Fnc, but I would watch the VOD."
738,"If you watch esports for the ""show"" and not the actual games on the rift - regardless of the cast - you're a chud.

That's the worst excuse in the world. NA just has a stigma of ""bad"" so people don't watch it anymore.

Same shit will happen to all the Western leagues over time as they can't win Worlds.

Games will change. Esports will change. Bandwagons will change. Count on it."
739,"> The problem doesnt lie in the actual teams playing in NA but how the broadcast work around that material.

So you think TL vs 100T would reach the same amount of viewers as DK vs T1 if the former was broadcasted properly then? And to say LEC’s success isn’t also tied to their results is kinda dumb IMO, especially because they’ve peaked in periods surrounding their best international showings.

100T are just all dead personalities and you see this outside of LCS(So it isn’t just an LCS issue), none of them are marketable. TL is similar, Jensen “died” when Bjerg retired and is not a franchise player, CoreJJ/Santorin are all PR and boring, Tactical doesn’t talk nor have fans, Alphari is decent but he wasn’t even playing for half the matches. 

Like sure, LCS is shit at broadcasting, but they’re given literally no content player/team-wise.

The only 2 and maybe 3 teams that give LCS something to work with are C9, EG and to a lesser extent, TSM. These teams aren’t scared of talking shit and have exciting play styles."
740,"It isn't even the hype. Why tune in to watch advertisements shoved down your throat and then suffer through the terrible NA gameplay? Other regions have sponsors and advertisements, but by god it is completely jarring watching the LCS."
741,"“LCK still plays extremely scared”

Man’s watched one GenG game and thinks everyone plays like this

Maybe MAD is similar to Damwon, but the rest of EU will get demolished by T1 or GenG"
742,"Lol its the same bullshit every year. Why do people have such a massive hate boner for the LCK?

Remember last year when people were downplaying the LCK and saying DWG's level couldn't be judged because clearly the rest of the LCK was so trash?"
743,"How is it the weakest it's been since 2018? Damwon is weaker than 2020 but still strong. Gen.G this year is stronger than 2020 Gen.G. T1 this year is stronger than DRX last year. T1 is the darkhorse, they can win Worlds with a few drafting and in-game adjustments."
744,Taking your kids out to touch grass is absolutely the right choice. Hope they are managing the pandemic ok.
745,Not having C9 or TSM in finals this year for sure hurt viewership.
746,"I don't know how popular it'll be in China moving forward, considering a significant portion of their player base will only be able to play 3 games a week."
747,"Yes, I was expecting a higher viewership as well for TSM vs C9, but I realized that by the time game 3 finished, it was basically 1-2am in Europe. Very few european viewers were awake to actually watch the most hype games.  

So basically, 100T vs TL got a relatively high viewership because it was Finals and an underdog story, and the entire series could fit into the viewing schedule of Eu and NA viewers.

C9 vs TSM got a slightly lower viewrship because it was ultimately only round 3 loser's bracket, and by the time the series got really close and hype and should have pulled more attention, most EU viewers had stopped watching and went to bed."
748,"Are you saying that none of what I said had any impact in the viewership? 

Like come on, 100T vs TL is the only LCS Bo5 I watched in its entirety of the entire season, I really don't care if LCK beats LCS in viewership. What I do care about though, is that from Germany, the LCS is at ungodly times and the only reason I managed to watch the finals entirely is because it was a quick win for 100T. The previous TL vs 100T series was way more interesting and hype, but I had to go bed after game 3, and it was only because I was in vacation and didn't care about my sleep schedule."
749,Bud Light doesn't exist in EU? I didn't know that. Is stuff like Heineken the EU equivalent?
750,"You have to think about the ads not individually selling to you per se. It's about casting a wide net. It's about brand recognition. Even if it doesn't necessarily appeal to you (at the moment), it could easily mean something to someone else.

It's why companies pay top dollar to get stadiums named after them. 

In a sense, it's also just a big flex for the companies to be part of such a popular thing. Though I will admit that the plugs are pretty ridic these days.

We are working our way toward the Taco Bell Buff Transfer or the Wendy's Smite Steal at this rate. Might as well put ad slots for every random thing in League."
751,"I like the kit kat add, go figure xD"
752,"> LCS has the addition of in-game ads and shoutouts non-stop. 

It cracks me up how bent out of shape people get over this."
753,"The only reason that would be the case would be if LEC games on average went longer, because both regions schedule a game each hour and stick pretty close to that."
754,"I play ARAM in between games for LCS, LEC, LCK and worlds. The down time inbetween games is quite long in all games"
755,I think it just feels longer. Time between games isnt all that different unless a game went quick/long.
756,"Dash is, in my humble opinion, the best host in esports. CaptainFlowers is one of the best play by play casters in esports. Emily is a terrific analyst. But I'm not watching LCS for the broadcast talent when the content sucks, the games suck, and I have to wait 30 minutes between meaningless Bo1 games."
757,"The desk used to be just Dash, MarkZ and Crumbz having a blast and it was great. They did the K/DA bet. They had the time Phoenix1 started to rise from the ashes so they had a skit after every game. Now, they're busy trying to be ESPN, but everyone hates ESPN."
758,Oh they sure as hell need new people - in the management.
759,"Not to mention how long they have been milking the same segments like ""this or that"". Like do it a couple of times when it's new, but let it die when it loses interest. Kobe seemed desperate to promote it in one of the series."
760,"I agree with everything, except that LCS has poor numbers because NA sucks internationally.
I think that’s a bit if a scapegoat of the actual issue, which is that it’s getting harder and harder to care. Most NA teams are only NA teams in name nowadays, there is no MAD to get excited about because most “new” players are just known names from other regions paid millions to slowly get worse. There is no FNC/G2 to get excited about because the best veterans retired. And because the teams are just musical chairs of imports there is no one to fill the gap.
Add to that the ridiculous 8/10 teams playoffs and the regular season is now a long, long irrelevant joke.
NA is failing because there is nothing really “NA” to cheer for anymore. We need more NA grown talent (doesn’t mean NA born btw) instead of new millionaires coming in to “dominate” only to become shadows of their former selves and taking potential NA talent spots.

Danny got tons of hype, now imagine if we got 5-10 new Dannys every season. (Yeah yeah I know it’s “”impossible”” because NA soloQ yada yada but still)"
761,People forget that along with rebranding LEC also got away from NA management. NA rebranding wasn't as effective as the decision makers stayed the same.
762,"Yeah this year has been pretty great for new content imo, but I'm probably more invested than the average viewer."
763,"I think the LCS crew is just bad at pivoting when things are clearly not working.

Those coach interviews at the start of the games, for example, it is just a terrible idea. Viewers complain, costreamers complain, the coaches are clearly not happy/comfortable doing them... But the broadcast kept pushing them through the playoffs.

I don't even think that LeTigress is a bad interviewer, the timing is just bad."
764,"Phreak has been phoning it in for like 6 years now. His new ""angry phreak"" shtick is fucking stupid and physically painful to listen to. Hes so grandfathered into LCS that hes reached the ""yelling at those damn kids to get off my lawn"" stage of senile."
765,Dash the blonde guy with glasses?
766,"Hard disagree. I think he's a good caster that has great chemistry with the other casters. He's also wonderful on the Dive.

What do you find so cringe about him?"
767,"Same. After years of constant NA disappointments, Valorant is an absolute godsend (thank you SEN)"
768,"> If you put the top 3 Korean rosters on TL, C9 and TSM I promise you NA's popularity would skyrocket.

Not only would it not ""skyrocket,"" but no one would give a shit and they'd get knocked out in QFs at best."
769,Who on 100t is a north American native?
770,"Right, the native NA players of

- Korean dude recently got a green card and thus gained NA residency

- Aussie dude recently got NA residency because Riot cut his Aussie league

- Another Korean dude who started his career in Korea, having grown up in Europe and Korea, and only gained NA residency via, surprise, a green card.

Ackchyually much?"
771,"Yeah outside of Kobe/flower and dark phreak. 

But the rest is just mediocre or badly used (Emily having to discuss with crumbz/prismal)"
772,"Play happens

*90+ second replay*"
773,The LCS interviews are so bland. You can see when a player starts to show too much personality that they just move straight on to someone who can spout the corporate pr that they want.
774,Perhaps I'm misreading your comment but I'm not sure I follow what you are saying.
775,"brazil also has their own personalities and brazilian players in their teams to cheer for even if they have bad results. it was the exact same with NA that also had tons of viewers even tho they had bad results at worlds but the fans loved their players. now you have 9/10 imports in the 2 best teams and they still suck so it's ""why even bother"" for many americans."
776,"it also helps that Brazil is absolutely in love with esports. just look at their support of their CS, Dota, R6, and LoL teams. they are nuts about them and will always support whoever goes to represent them internationally, regardless of allegiance."
777,"Because Brazil is a wildcard region, obviously the expectations are different.

 Also you can be certain that Brazilian viewership would nearly double if one of their teams ever reaches semis at Worlds or something. After s5, when Pain had a good showing in s5 Worlds, there was incredible hype and viewership, that leveled off after the terrible performances in subsequent MSI/Worlds"
778,"brazil is kinda an underdog in the world stage tho...USA/LCS is supposed to be top dog, so its disappointing when were constantly getting crushed at world stages"
779,">Edit -- and it's not like EU didn't make semi-finals at Worlds 4x between 2012 and 2016. Making finals is better, but EU did well enough internationally before.


 H2k run wasnt really seen as a big success by many people, because to reach semis H2k faced a wildcard team that quite frankly got hard exposed in a Bo5.

 OG and Fnatic runs were commendable, but also left a bitter taste because both semis were complete stomps. Especially after the Fnatic series there was a huge disappointment, and a gloomy feeling that Europe will never be able to compete with Korea.

 Besides Worlds 2018 which renewed hope, the ultimate turning point was when EU **actually won** a big international tournament. G2 reaching Worlds finals the same year further cemented the trust in the region, which is reflected in the big viewership rise of 2019-2020

 Im not saying that LEC production doesnt do a great job. But i dont think it would be able to salvage much if EU teams didnt take their international performances one step further"
780,This. most of the viewers LCS lost were EU. Why do we care if NA is good internationally. We just want entertainment at a time we can watch
781,"Compared to former seasons the loss of Alphari, Perkz and Abbe were peanuts"
782,"> I would still rather watch shitty NA talent go against each other than watch imports come here and replicate the same results domestically and internationally.

So you watch academy religiously every week, right?"
783,"afaik it's literally always been 15-20 minutes as well? I believe MarkZ brought on up hotline league once that they aim for 17 mins, and that they more or less always have."
784,"Alphari leaving really made me sad about NA imports. Felt like top had been a bit of an underperforming role for EU for a while and then we lose a great toplaner. Also as a Brit it was sad seeing Alphari go as we are rare in the LEC, beyond the commentary teams."
785,"If NA folded you could expand to 4 more teams in LEC with the number of EU players in NA plus the few NA and OCE pros who would come with it. 

LCS is dropping and personally I think its better if Riot voluntarily goes for Superleague rather than letting the bubble pop."
786,Olive stood out among those names.  Won academy in 2019 anyways.
787,"> Crazy take here but NA bad and LCS should be cancelled

He's so brave."
788,Sure but they would be much stronger with players like corejj and ssumday etc.
789,Would it actually? I think the additional hype that strict no-import rules would bring to LCK and LEC would outweigh the damage it would do to NA.
790,Most of that money goes into NA
791,"> Like I don’t get why EU gets 100 countries (exaggerating) of talent with various languages, and NA gets USA and Canada

Eh, does it matter if you have 10 countries with 10 million people or 1 country with 100 million?

Hell, LEC doesn't even include the most populous European country (Russia) among others, so Riot arbitrarily restricting countries is nothing special to LCS. Like, imagine being born in Russia or Ukraine or Belarus, being a European literally by birth, and then being told you are an import in the League ""European"" Championship, lol.

Also, LCS being fewer, larger countries is probably more helpful than being more, smaller countries. Speaking different languages creates a language barrier (since speaking in a second or third language is not the same as speaking your mother tongue), and there will be cultural barriers as well as legal hurdles. It is a much bigger decision in life to move from Italy to Germany than it is to move from Canada to the US, or one US state to another."
792,the foreign viewers aren't worth as much as NA viewers anyway if we're talking business
793,"There are a lot of sponsors and advertisers in the NFL but thank god they’re not saying shit like “wow, what a great Pepsi Touchdown! Now they have their choice between the Geico extra point, or the 2-point Chik-Fil-A conversion!!”

Advertisements and sponsors are fine but every aspect of the game has been corporatized in the LCS. Red Bull Baron Buff, FTX gold graph, Bud Light Ace, there used to be the “replay brought to you by Alienware”, there’s the Honda MVP, State Farm analyst desk, and more that I’m probably forgetting. 

God it’s so obnoxious, I just want to watch them play the game."
794,"I find it grating as a NA viewer.  I feel like we do have ad inserts in NA sports, but not nearly to the degree they are inserted in League.  They've inserted advertising space into phrases that get uttered by casters multiple times every minute.  It would be the equivalent of giving a sponsorship to every three point shot in the NBA.  Do we have shit like the ""AT&T Second Down"" in the NFL?  No.  League absolutely got ridiculous with it and the product has definitely suffered."
795,"wait until its the Amazon Boots of Swiftness
or the UPS Boots of Mercury"
796,"The FTX one annoyed me at first cause it was constantly on screen and they would say it so much, but by the end it only did very little"
797,"Yeah ""Red Bull Baron Play"" ""Mercedes drive to victory"" we have it as well, it's just not in your face tho as much"
798,Our analyst desk does not explain the New Grubhub Offer and how you can save 2 dollars using it
799,"Bit of a difference between having a logo somewhere and literally shouting the names of sponsors in games. 

All sports have advertising. I only really follow rugby outside of League and the sponsors are never said unless it's the name of the stadium or the club (which is really only the South African clubs). LCS is the only sport that I would watch where literally every objective, replay, moment in a game has a sponsor. It's way too much."
800,"Do they say FTX gold adv. is x every 2 minutes?

It's just unnatural to hear it."
801,"> LEC also shows their sponsors **during games**

Any examples?"
802,"It's the meme of the last year or 2 on this sub, nobody cares about reality it's just free karma to bitch about the sponsors"
803,Yeah I find this criticism dumb. Also if it helps fund the league what is the problem.
804,"Yes but aside from Fnatic there is maybe one pause every 2 weeks and I don't watch the analyst desk (on both broadcasts). And even then, you only have the player of a series thing once a game, not once every two or three minutes. If they just did their spiel at the start and end of game I honestly wouldn't even complain, but the frequency makes it really grating."
805,Yeah so they can sell more t-shirts/have better branding. If it would make them earn more all the NA t-shirts would be covered up in sponsors as well.
806,"I’d rather have silent but present sponsors than getting bombarded by beer and chicken wings 

NBA final 25 minutes take hours because time-outs are filled to the brim with ads, on top of the ads already being played between quarters

You Americans are used to it, and we’re not. Stop trying to apply your habits on us, plus there are sponsorless kits for sale usually"
807,"I rather have that than getting it showed in my face. I already don't like kitkat being shoved in my face, I would get even more annoyed if it was even more than that."
808,[deleted]
809,As a european I would much rather have summoners rift covered up with banners rather than having to hear fucking FTX gold advantage.
810,"I mean a sponsor on a Shirt doesnt speak

A caster saying lets go to the state farm break or ftx Gold advantage just Sounds awful

And yes Acer predator replays does adwell

Or Red Bull Baron Power play"
811,Yes because the picture on a jersey that I can't really make out on tv is the same as hearing the name of a company pressed into a normal cast every minute. If they had company logos on the small banners on the map that everyone ignores I wouldn't have said anything. Even if I think the FTX logo next to the superfluous gold advantage is a but ridiculous I would never complain about that
812,"They have the team logo (which is way more important than the name to us, since the name is often just ""FC [city]"" anyway) on the heart, that's symbolically the most important place. Who looks at what is on the chest anyway?"
813,"Let's not forget the BARCLAYS premiere league 

Never had the McDonald's Football League or the Coca-cola baseball league last time I checked"
814,"Yes, it's 3 mb. Still extremely low.



LCS has lost its essence. A lot of people knew this could happen, since we saw something similar with Starcraft. But yet it happened here again. You can't just have a league that consists of players taken from other regions. A league that despite that isn't even competitive internationally. What's the appeal there? Brazil sucks internationally, but they are still growing. Why? Because Brazil still represents Brazil. Even if they have some imports. You can no longer say LCS represents NA when less than half of the players are actually from NA."
815,"I dunno, the ""FTX Gold Advantage"" is somehow worse. It's like if I was watching basketball and every time they mentioned the current score they said, ""The Coca Cola Score Check is 10 to (Coke) Zero."" The LCS branding choice here is as dumb as supporting the trash that is FTX or Bud Light. Riot really peddling gambling and alcohol at kids, so I guess in that respect they've made the big leagues."
816,They actively work on increasing the advertising in video games that simulate the sports
817,"It just feels incredible unnatural and business like to hear casters mention sponsorships by name midgame, like it sucks out the fun/enjoyment from the product (watching a League match).  
  
Hearing FTX gold advantage! or Red Bull baron power play! just feels wrong.  
  
If it's just them having the name on the corners on the stream it's certainly more tolerable than hearing the casters say it for me.  

I am already not a guy watching much LCS, so it doesn't take much for me to quit the stream."
818,"Dunno, why you would talk in such a condescending way.  
  
I am far from naïve. It's not rocket science.  

Of course the advertiser bring in enormous money to the League, but the way it's implemented is what bothers me.  
Having casters shout ""FTX! gold advantage"" midgame just distracts from the game and is simply unappealing.  
  
Of course the League has to make money somewhere.  
There is plenty of ways to make advertisements that don't disturb the product (LCS).  
  
Before the game starts, after the game is over, ads on the stream on the corner/sides where they don't distract.  
  
Oh wait, they already do all of that."
819,"These are the same EU fan boys who stan formula 1 where the team is literally called red bull racing with more patches on his vest and decals on his car than nations in the EU, and nobody gives a fuck. 

But that same person  will turn off a North American show after hearing the words ""ftx gold advantage""

I don't trust EU opinion for shit, they are incredibly biased against LCS and America in general, just read this thread and you can see."
820,"You know what makes the league money? People playing the game. It makes more than enough money to sustain the LCS, they're just greedy and want even more...even though it's supposed to be a way to get more people playing.

Nothing is for free, they're getting more benefit from you watching then you'll ever get out of it."
821,Kotex First Blood
822,"Yeah, simple math really"
823,"yep LEC does it too, but either they have less sponsor or they tried to not sell too many ad spots - but it isn't nearly as annoying as in LCS."
824,"European sports plasters the athletes with ads. I'd rather have sponsored segments than quality team kits destroyed. 

Esports gets the worst of both worlds ...

825,"Why the low blows? I like it, and a back handed comment won’t change that."
826,two*
827,"Eh, I like it and a monologue won’t change that."
828,Emily is good but Kaizen is a complete miss. Really terrible honestly.
829,"Just want to make sure someone defends Emily a bit. She's the best analyst on the desk, by far.

And she's so good at it that Mark has returned to form after like 3 seasons of him looking bored af on the desk from shitty takes/analysis. He actually engages and pays attention now.

But the rest I won't defend."
830,Think hes making a joke about frosk
831,yeah but Europeans = white so they are all the same and not diverse /s
832,If it is done naturally and not being forced it is actually good but having people there just to fill quota isnt helping anybody
833,"Problem is you have to these days

If you don’t have a female etc in your line up, your going to get chewed out by the fans

It’s just the politically correct thing to do, every corporation has quotas now, you need to save face

And before people get triggered at me: Im not saying any female on the LCS desk is like this and not deserving etc, I don’t even watch the LCS anymore"
834,Europe moment
835,No racism please
836,"Horrible take lol people pissed and moaned about 100T crashing and burning into worlds on championship points *from spring* and literally ending Cody Sun's LCS career for a diamond ADC. This format fixes that. We need to stop imagining a ""perfect format"" that'll make everyone watch and just realize it's the games themselves that suck, and not in a fun Dignitas getting double executed by herald type of fiesta way"
837,The battle for the LCS trophy is meaningless? While deciding who gets to be the one to lose in groups this year is exciting? Think you need to change your priorities lol.
838,"I know most people on this subreddit are young but your argument skills could use some real work. If something is good why doesn't XYZ do it is such a bad argument to prove something is bad. Lock-in tournament was a huge success that only NA does. 

I'm really not sure where your second argument comes from though. It lets bad teams fuck around because there are no stakes? What the fuck are you saying? The teams that won games in regular season and ranked higher ended up going to worlds in NA. The teams that fucked around didn't. How were those teams that fucked around rewarded? GGS got eliminated first round, was that a reward? Is making playoffs THAT BIG of a reward? I don't think you'll find many orgs that think so."
839,"Huni definitely has quite a bit of support in NA. I would agree it's not as good as when he was in EU though but he was still an import then. He has played in NA more than any other region.

Huhi, Bjeg, Jensen, ect are all 'imports' who have made a name for themselves in NA and feel very much like NA players.

I think players like Perkz will never feel like a NA players and will always be looked at as in import but most of the imports don't."
840,"Because the teams aren't good. If they were winning worlds, no one would care they are imports except other region fans. You can change everyone to 100% na players and they level of play would be worse and even less people would want to watch. There have been full NA roster teams before and the views for the games were significantly less."
841,"So like, one that that even the NFL hesitates to do is sponsoring in-game elements. Touchdowns, field goals, kickoffs, huddles, 2-point conversions, first downs, 3rd down conversions, I have NEVER heard of any of those things being sponsored. This is a line that not even the NFL crosses, but the LCS is doing it like mad.  

""State farm analyst desk"" is par for the course in America, and pretty fine, imo, but ""Bud Light Ace"" is absolutely absurd."
842,"Are we watching the same LEC broadcast lol? Can't go 5 mins without them mentioning Kia or KitKat. Not to mention the robot Col Sanders that pops up every game in the LPL. Haven't watched much LCK recently, so can't comment on that"
843,"Doing better by what metric? I haven’t seen the numbers for each league, but I would guess the LCS’s revenue would be much lower if not for sponsors."
844,"That makes sense, but I don’t really see it as this super big criticism when they are obviously targeting a North American audience, where it is commonplace and not seen as a big deal."
845,"What a sheep, wanting the league I watch to be sustainable. How could I."
846,"Yeah G2 and FNC would boost the viewers, but thats primarily because of the work of the LEC broadcast team to bring their personalities out. You can name almost any playoffs player/team in LEC and the broadcast has given the player both an in game and out of game personality, what development has LCS given to their players this split?"
847,but why should i watch the broadcast then ? the teams job is to create good players that bring success ingame. not to create some youtube stream personality`s. that the job of the broadcast team.
848,Na has consistently been the number 4/5 reigon for years. There’s a clear divide in personalities from the past vs current ones
849,"Well pure viewership numbers wouldn't be able to show you how much of the people watching are from NA vs EU. I'm sure Riot has the data on this, but the public doesn't for sure."
850,Yeah but they lost people they don't care about. So the decline is irrelevant if it's EU people that they don't want to market to
851,If NA viewership is up and international viewership is down that can still be considered a good thing for NA advertisers.
852,An American viewer is worth roughly 2.5 the amount of a European viewer.  So if LCS goes from 200k average viewers of majority Europeans to 150k majority Americans then it's a viewership win
853,"The question is if they care about all viewers or only marketable viewers. If the first, then sure. If second, like I don't think Bud Light is very present on EU market, then why would they care."
854,!RemindMe 2 months
855,"You mean the same FLY that was eliminated after the first FOUR games going 1-3 ?

yeah must be nice to win games when you are alrdy eliminated.

how about you win those games when you still compete for 2nd place

TL needed G2 to win their last game to FORCE a tiebreaker, that is not the same as making it out of groups with ""1"" more win but rather TWO."
856,"Only 3 year ago, eh?    Like Realkudgel said, ' TL had to win 2 games and FQ needed TES to lose all their remaining 3 games to force a tie-breaker - FQ damn near had to win 4 games in a row and TES had to lose 3 games in a row to even stand a chance at making it out.  

It just seems more times than not NA teams are knocked out game 6th-7th out of the 12 scheduled more frequent now.  

2018 TL eliminated:  EDG vs TL   KT vs MAD remained. 

2018 100 eliminated: FNC vs G-REX.   100 vs IG.    G-REX vs 100.   IG vs FNC remained.  

2019 C9 eliminated:  C9 vs G2.   HKA vs C9.   G2 vs GRF remained.  

2019 CG eliminated:  CG vs RNG.   SKT vs CG.   FNC vs RNG remained. 

2020 TSM eliminated:  LGD vs GEN.   TSM vs GEN.   FNC vs LGD.   LGD vs TSM.   GEN vs FNC remained.  

2020 FQ eliminated:  DRX vs UOL.   TES vs FQ.   UOL vs FQ.   DRX vs TES remained. 

Yes, NA at times shows up but it's typically at the last moment and barely do so via 3-3 more times than not."
857,The thing is they didn't go away that's the difference.  Green Bay got over Brett Favre because he literally went away.  Meanwhile Sneaky Memeos and LiftLift save league is probably combined more popular than the official riot cast.  Also Favre was kind of a dick.  Especially with the way Sneaky was forced out I've found myself actively rooting against a team I used to love.  It would be like if Milwaukee forced Khris to retire somehow and then brought in Harden a perpetual playoff choker but a theoretical higher ceiling vs steady as hell and occasionally will go off despite not being fed resources.
858,"What i don't understand is how come i don't have any connection to the new LCS players, when i love most if not all new rookies in LEC. Is it a production diff, or what?"
859,They're boring personalites. Sjokz is someone who is a great female talent and so is Laurie they're fun and bubbley. Emily rand and Letigress aren't bad at their job they're just not interesting. I was a fan of Hai as a player but he's boring as Batshit and I think the way the information is presented isnt great either. Need some things like skits. It doesn't seem like the people on the broadcast click that well either. NA casters are great though. Raz is boring too. I don't care how nice or good hearted they are I want personalities.
860,id stay up all night long with DL and Bjerg
861,"I'mna be real with you chief, a tab in chrome isn't staying up until 8PM (I'm in US East) for me to watch Lost and PowerOfEvil."
862,"Spica is pretty much the only 1 on TSM that has any sort of a brand on TSM atm. Like compare Spica's social media game to his teammates, it's not even close."
863,Withered wojak wearing c9 and tsm jersey
864,How does the bigger broadcast time afect the peak viewership?
865,">Lol. So is there some other place where EU fans discuss the game? 

Yes? Channels where they can speak their native language for example lol???"
866,"They are almost assuredly losing viewership over production.  There was constant complaining over how terrible the talent was and how terrible the pacing and content was before, during, and after games.  LeTigress is professional but she doesn't know the game and asks softball/cliche questions pretty much 100% of the time.  Sjokz has more talent in her pinky toe than LeTigress does in her entire being.  Ovilee wasn't terrible but still definitely not a Sjokz.

It made me skip a lot of broadcasts and just watch VODs of the games on Youtube."
867,"So did Bjergsen but he was still considered an import from a fan perspective.  Huhi started his professional career in Korea.  He is a Korean citizen.  He took up an import slot.  Sure, he has residency now but he is still technically an import."
868,Iirc the numbers are x10 as to say a NA viewer is 10 times more valubal than a brazilian for example.
869,"while all of this is true, i'm sure that the fact that the viewership is stagnating and declining isnt a good sign for the future in terms of sponsors. It might make them hesitant to sign longer term deals"
870,1 NA viewer is worth 10 Chinese viewers. We have more money so our eyes are worth more.
871,LFL > NA Academy. They actually produce too tire talent unlike Academy.
872,The separation that makes sense imo is calling top ERLs tier 2 together with EU Masters and smaller ERLs tier 3
873,EU Masters is just the CL
874,Nah this ain’t it. Academy is a joke. Listen to any pro who gets benched to academy and comes back. Zven being the most recent who speaks on it.
875,I mean most major regions are just a country.
876,And the 2nd tier french league has more viewers than NA academy
877,Move that goal post
878,"it begins to make more sense when you take into account that, a) France is becoming a powerhouse in esports, and b) unlike LCS which represents 1-3 countries (at least based on location and depending on how you split it), LEC needs to represent dozens. so it makes sense that some countries have national leagues that rival those of major regions since not every country gets representation in the league and people want to see their country's best even they aren't on the biggest stage."
879,Imagine reading the article instead of instantly writing a comment based on the headline. Peak reddit moment.
880,"My guess is that the time block between games is set, and putting the ads in those 3minutes will only mean the analyst desk has to talk for longer in between games, and people are definitely going to complain about that if that happened."
881,"> why the fuck they have that 3 minutes completely wasted? Put your ads there or try to sell the spot for ads.

Ye, either run twitch ads or your sponsors"
882,"On which streaming platform that you've used have you seen anything. I've tried all of the different ones (I usually use YouTube, but twitch, Azubu, treo, can't remember which other ones but I've never seen an ad)."
883,Sucks to be you. FPX hypetrain taking off in 5
884,"Yeah I'm aware, doesn't make it any less enjoyable to watch personally."
885,"the thing is, they could, they just don't want to. instead we watch the useless preshow and analyst desk for 20 mins + a 5 minute ad-screen"
886,"You could say the same about most sporting events, though. There is a sense of excitement that I get when watching LoL (or soccer or football) live that I don't have when I watch a recorded version. But it could also be the anxiety of going on any social media and having the score spoiled for me as well."
887,"LPL casting is my favorite of all regions, I miss Raz though"
888,Mostly same except I'm a dirty TSM fan
889,That's a good life decision
890,"Yes but due to corona a lot more people work from home, and can open the stream while still working."
891,"You also underestimate the amount of people that can, and do watch streams like that *in* school or work.

The bigger the class/lecture is, the easier it is to watch a stream muted, especially if it's completely normal to have a tablet or a laptop on your desk. Office work is also something that easily often allows that, especially if it's something you just tab in to every now and then and otherwise have it in the background without audio."
892,"Fair enough but it's still super boring 90% of the time, there must be a better way of filling the void"
893,"It is a banger, even Rekkless said so himself"
894,"not just that but their whole LEC Quiz, Rap Battles plus having the balls to meme themselves to death is also part of the charm. Sjokz has a roulette to make cursed monologue about a team. As much as DL was a bit of an ass with his banter, it brought something. Adam flaming Wunder after not taking his scrim seriously, G2 memes, etc.  


LCS has extremely good caster and that's about it. Phreak and CaptainFlowers are just the best. The production is trash, the teams are trash, the observer are trash, there's no narrative other than ""who has the best import"" and ""11m$ vs 3m$ match"" narrative."
895,"TBH, even when it was still EU LCS the players were still great on camera. Remember that analyst desk section with Perkz and Jankos on it? That was great.

896,"This right here, your story is amplified by the storytellers and sjokz does a masterful job weaving narrative and making games and player rivalries impacts seem so large."
897,"i like the ftx gold advantage, you can more easily see the gold swings because you see the number all the time, would love for lec to add that aswell (you mean the +gold number a team is ahead right? :P)"
898,"a vtuber is literally just a human being that's not using a webcam. idk why everyone gets so worked up over them, as if the mere sight of an animated model sends piss and shit down their legs."
899,"Yup as an NA person, LCS times are perfect, so I guess they're getting what they want."
900,"And that would be fine, if they could actually then focus on their audience and retain their numbers. LCS has a *significantly* larger potential audience than LFL, and LFL is a non-english national league with zero Worlds implications, yet LFL draws in an average of 90k viewers for the average Karmine Corp game. LCS is at [125k average viewers. ](https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/lcs-2021-summer)

And it's pretty clear why, too. The French know how to really throw energy and hype into their scene, especially Karmine Corp. It's unfortunate that the LCS scene doesn't at least *try* to do something similar. I dont know a word of French, and neither that nor the scuffed setup for Solari vs Karmine Corp did anything to detract from the spectacle it was. 

LCS is too... corporate, somehow. Soulless. It just feels too ""this is what focus groups tell us works"", and this goes for both the broadcast and the orgs. We are missing someone willing to really make a splash and fire up the show, and the way to do it isn't to be this overly professional. 

But maybe that's what the sponsors want, and in that case, I guess we can't expect it to change."
901,"Just add 1hr and move it to 22 when LEC ends, it's almost impossible for most of the people to watch NA if they start at 24"
902,"They overhype the narratives but not just about everything. One thing I hated last year that seems to have improved is that everything is a big play. Lee Sin hitting a Q in a pretty standard gank? ""Omg Lee Sin goes in for the BIG DAMAGE""

I don't know, I just don't really enjoy that style. As I said, it can perfectly be just me that dislikes it, I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing."
903,"This will not stop you from watching our BEST teams compete against each other IF they were viewed as competitive teams on the world stage. TSM getting 0-6 while being first seed has it's consequences in that manner.

Will not believe that you will just ""close the stream"" and simply not watch"
904,"Absolutely disagree. if our top teams were viewed as competitive teams against other international competition, then we get more attraction.

People don't watch NA because there's no point to. It has nothing to do with the  teams ACTUAL SKILL, t's all about how they are perceived.

Imagine if closer made his first blood lee sin play, that he did against Santorin, on the international stage. you're just going to disregard his future games back in NA, because of a couple of sponsors? no way. his stocks go way up"
905,I like Jizuke. You know what made me like him? Surely not the LCS. It was the crackdown.
906,I mean its never been good times for NA either until these past 2 years.  The time slot changes make sense if NA was doing a lot of the production back in the day.
907,Ninja is playing league for the better part of the last half year and look what it did to his viewer numbers.
908,Yes that’s my point. Evey league suffered from this.
909,Summer normally gets less viewers but it is weird 2021 summer is lower then 2020
910,"First i don't.

Second, you can keep your elitist mentality if you want, that's how you create content nobody watches.

Making a content pleasant to watch doesnt mean you are appealing to normies or people who don't know what they are watching. I watch professional games since season 2 and the LCS nowadays is just bad to watch because you have delay that last forever between games and very little interesting content except for the game on its own."
911,"Ahh of course the guy  telling other people how they are allowed to enjoy  things, there is always one of those chuds ."
912,I agree with the point about style but I don’t think that a FNC vs T1 or RGE vs GENG match would be as one-sided as u seem to be insinuating.

914, people are really sleeping on dk. They are as strong as 2020 imo.
915,"> T1 is the darkhorse, they can win Worlds with a few drafting and in-game adjustments.

Yea, if someone knocks out DK for them first... drafts won't overcome gap we had during final... and if someone can beat DK without clutching (so no 50/50 3:2 series, but e.g.: strong 3:1, or 3:0 sweep), they can take on T1 as well.

Also DK atm is stronger than they were in 2020, yea they were worse during spring/msi/beginning of summer, but it did change."
916,I am a going to turn on yourtube during game 5 World Finals of 100T vs FPX though.
917,">LCS is at ungodly times

LCS is at a shit time slot for people living in NA too.  Week nights, sure but why the fuck would I want to give up my weekend to watch League?  Even in earlier seasons when there were better storylines and hype around the teams it was a struggle to set that time aside to watch the games.

It doesn't help that there's so much fucking time before and between games."

Certain individuals that this subreddit has a hate boner for called this out back in Season 2 as a stupid path to go down for that exact reason. After all the entertaining NA players that rose up in the pre-LCS era + original Cloud9 + Bjerg retired, why would anyone give a shit about this league anymore? I am more interested in the Tyler1 Championship Series."
930,yeah unpopular opinion but crumbz is funny and entertaining and better than everyone but markz on the anaylst desk
931,"I feel the current desk is flawed. I know they're clearly trying, but the ideal chemistry isn't there. Also, the half-forced jokes don't help as well."
932,"yea, that's a better way of wording it"
933,"That's the boat I'm in tbh. I have no connection to any team after FQ blew up and let everyone go, no old school players that I'm interested in for the personality, and no interest in world's because I don't want to watch a team I don't care about get demolished.

LCS needs to improve their talent pipeline and start making waves on the world stage before I'm interested again."
934,"I think its harder to care because of the results NA gets when vs'ing the international competition. If NA wants to grow again, they have to first shed the stigma of... well being NA. If NA continues to stay non competitive at international events, then current viewers get frustrated and leave, and potential viewers either,

a) watch different leagues

b) watch a different esport

The whole import point doesn't matter. Its never mattered to NA viewers, both old and new. Some of our most popular players in history are imported, Bjerg, Jensen, CoreJJ, Impact, Locodoco, Lustboy, Santorin, Piglet, Huhi, and now probably Perkz + Alphari if they stick around.

We also have new NA born faces that are starting to build names for themselves in Spica, Blaber, Tactical, and Danny. Not to mention young imported (OCE isn't imported now anyways) talent to be excited about like Closer, Fudge, and FBI. 

>there is no MAD to get excited about because most “new” players are just known names from other regions paid millions to slowly get worse.

NA's MAD Lions are 100T right now, they may not be all born NA players but they are new faces (mostly) at the top of the scene and an exciting team to watch. 

>There is no FNC/G2 to get excited about because the best veterans retired.

C9 and TSM both have newer players that they are both excited about, C9 with Fudge + Blaber and TSM with Spica.

tl;dr The only thing that will help NA grow again is shedding the negative stigma around the League, which is getting favorable results at international competition."
935,"Fully agree. NA needs to stop talking about investing in rookies and actually do it properly with proper coaching and infrastructure. 

Nobody is gonna be interested in a league that just keeps shuffling the same imports between teams as they slowly get more and more washed up before replacing them with the new big paycheck import.

I want NA to have NA players in the teams again so there's actually a regional rivalry instead of just a region of imported talent."
936,"Again though LEC does the same thing and dont have viewership problems.

Though I would love them to stop doing those interviews in both regions, almost always pointless and detract from the game going on."
937,And they ask the stupidest questions about strategy that the coaches will obviously not answer for everyone to hear
938,"> I don't even think that LeTigress is a bad interviewer

I don't think she's ""bad"" as in doesn't have media skills or whatever, I think she's ""bad"" as in asking *garbage* questions to the point where the interview literally adds zero value"
939,yes I think so
940,I didn't like him at first but then I watched him and flowers do that casting stream where they casted their bronze friend's games and I finally got Azael. He's my favorite color caster now.

943,Facts

946,Since when is NA supposed to be a top dog? You guys are kinda meh in nearly every esport except for import teams.
947,"I dont agree with h2k thing. First of all Alubs Nox finished 2nd in pretty hard group with best/close to best KR team ,first EU seed. Also h2h managed to top their group , and it wasnt common in these days to any western team win their group...."
948,"MSI and Worlds 2015 was more disheartening to me. We got so far, but in the end it didn't even matter. Kinda stopped following after 2017 and came back when G2 won MSI 2019."
949,Exactly. I dont watch LPL even though I wish I could cause the time works
950,"Dude, Perkz is like the best or second best EU player ever. It was not peanuts. LCS keeps hurting other regions every year. And now you see people here talking about losing Bjergsen an Doublelift, as if EU hadn't lost their ""Bjergsen"" and ""Doublelift every other year since 2014 or so."
951,"No because that's not the main competition and there are no stakes involved. Nice try for a gotcha moment, though. Are you done trying to be an idiot yet?"
952,"No stakes, olive could've easily moved up years ago but a pandemic needed to occur for an NA mid to make it through lcs management."
953,yeah they are normally between 20 and 23 minutes when I timed a weekend. that's from nexus exploding to draft of the next game starting.
954,"ya'll need to get your narratives right, is NA a clown region washed up players come to retire at, or is it a fiesta region who steals good talent with their wallets?"
955,"The LCS going away or going to WC status would certainly drop the views. The more competitive major regions there are, the more hype and the more views. The comment I replied to wasn't a 'no import rule', it was a 'LCS just dies'."
956,"I dunno, my ""nope"" moment of US broadcasting was back in 2008 or so when in NBA during a free throw a Gatorade ad showed at the side of the screen and the commentators straight up said, ""...sponsored by Gatorade, quench your thirst (paraphrased)"".

LEC casters don’t do sponsored segments about grub hub and if they did I’d be bitching about that too. 

I honestly just turned off the LCS stream. I love the shoutcasting but the constant name dropping ruined it for me. 

I’m from a country where this kind of advertisement is ILLEGAL. You are not allowed to mix content and advertisement here. So I grew up enjoying media without it. It’s super cringeworthy to experience the ads embedded into the content now"

968,">I am already not a guy watching much LCS, so it doesn't take much for me to quit the stream. 

Yeah, this is what I thought. Sorry if this next part comes off as rude, but may I ask why your opinion matters then? Like, if such a small (imo) change was enough to push you out, why would they ever bend over backwards to retain viewers like yourself? Taking this sponsorship means +money and -viewers that were never going to stay. Good deal, no?"
969,"You compare a team name to sponser names added to things that would be said. Also the problem is not what you see, the problem is when commentator have to say these sponsor names as added to different part of the game."
970,Do people not play this game? I’m confused. What’re you trying to say?
971,A team having sponsors on their own kit isn't the same as broadcasters having sponsors.

Hyundai on the shoulder, Nike Swoosh  because they made the thing and then the main sponsor on the chest."
973,"But there they are just on uniforms (or on the stadium walls), they are not said repeatedly during the broadcast. I can watch a complete football game and never hear the name of a single company, except in the names of stadiums (and that is only briefly mentioned) and of course the one ad break during the game."
974,Cause he's European lol. Always has to have a superiority complex.
975,But… LCK/LPL/LEC all show you the gold… you don’t need a sponsored tracker doing 8 year olds math for you…
976,"I don't mind it being on screen, it's handy if you're not particularly good at math, even if you are, there's no downside to it, it takes a really small space and you can focus more on the game. The problem with NA broadcast is that casters are required to abide by the sponsorship name, they can't say baron power play or baron play, they HAVE to say redbull baron power play every single time.

They can't talk about what the analyst desk said before the game, it's the statefarm analyst desk. It's not a replay, it's willy wonka's dildo factory replay.

Sponsors need to trust that the audience can read the statefarmlogo plastered all over, we can read the little ftx before gold advantage and we know that redbull is what makes baron strong."
977,"You do you I guess, but if you're so diluted to the point of accepting to hear the name of a sponsor every couple minutes instead of doing a mental subtraction once in a while, I really don't know what to tell you."
978,"I do agree with that, she made fan signs too."
979,"True. She really should be praised as being insightful, truly dedicated and having been active for a seriously long time versus the ones who are on the cast seemingly because they were hired because they could also have some fun doing it."

There, fixed your small typo."
985,Damn cannot believe how stupid you are. Reading it shows just how narrowminded go educate yourself old timer and stop hanging out on reddit. No longer gonna reply cuz I see you still put NA on your imaginary pedestal lmao. The teams that fuck around were c9 and TL and they still made worlds btw idiot no stake region.
986,"I'll bite lol. My personal feeling is that Spring still barely matters except for MSI, and Summer also barely matters. In both LEC and LCS, playoffs are the only part of the season that matters, and every team in the LCS that is not apocalyptically bad makes playoffs.

Team Liquid placed 3rd in Spring and 5th in Summer, but are still 2nd seed going into Worlds because of their playoffs performance. The fact that they benched their best player for most of the split didn't matter at all.. TSM meanwhile placed 2nd and tied 1st, respectively, and missed. This happened last year to Cloud 9 too. So you have a system where regular season games aren't a barrier to playoffs because every team that's not just a depressing shell of themselves makes it, and where regular season success doesn't make a team much more likely to win a championship. This is further watered down by the length of the season, such that any individual regular season LCS game is basically meaningless down the stretch. It's enough that the games where Alphari, Zven, Abbedagge, and Danny weren't playing didn't matter, whether those games were in Spring or Summer

Additionally,  this isn't the fault of the format per se, but there was no real compelling playoff race to drive any investment down the stretch in the LCS. While in the LEC you could at least pay lip service to Astralis or Excel beating out a newly revamped Vitality roster, and in the LPL, IG and LGD, among others, both missed out, whichever of FlyQuest and Golden Guardians made it was moot because both were just going to get their clocks cleaned by whichever of the top 4 teams they faced. Maybe next year the bottom of the table will be a bit stronger in the LCS, but this year, of the teams in the bottom half of the table, only Immortals showed any signs of life"
987,"Bjergsen is no longer playing, I like how you keep giving 1-2 example of exemption then add ""etc."" as if it's the norms

Sssumday,FBI, Lost, Closer, Power of Evil has been here for enough time to qualify as a resident, they made 0 effort to connect with fans.  Alphari, Abbedage, Swordart are the new added edition but they are not willing to break the mold of being invisible.

Zven, Perkz bring the shit talk with them and failed but at least he tries to show he has any personality whatsoever, they have been G2 for so long that it's hard to accept it.

And this is just listing from the top 4 teams."
988,LCK is basically free of ads for the global broadcast since there's no point of advertising Hana Bank or SKT 5G to an international audience
989,"Kit kat is only mentioned during pauses? And KIA only after the game for ""player of the game""?

Give a single example of a sponsor shoutout during the actual gameplay. 

Seems like you are definitely watching some different broadcast."
990,"... international success? The goal of competing is to win, and LCS is by far the worst at that"
991,"LCS is targeting NA only. LEC does not. People want to feel included. I dont really care what StateFarm is but its weird to know that NA is like ""i dont care about you"". Many people dont like that."
992,">obviously targeting a North American audience

The inability to reach out to an international audience is what keeps their views down though, since they aren't working to *create* an NA audience either."
993,LEC seems to be doing fine without this shit and is far more popular.
994,"This is probably hard to accept but international results produce at least or more viewers than these ""personalities"" take.

Bjergsen and Doublelift carried the region off their names alone in terms of viewership because of their domestic titles and Double was constantly cycled in the big three (CLG back in its golden days).

Personalities start to get marketed more if they are actual winners. You can have the best personality in eSports but if your region is literally 0-11 at worlds then it'll eventually get old."
995,Riot's job is to broadcast the game. It's not Riot's job to turn the corpses that play in the LCS into personalities. Teams could easily display their players and what they are like.
996,All viewers are marketable. There are lots of companies operating in North America and Europe. Driving away your European just limits your future potential.
997,Exactly.  TL needed to win 2 games alone and FQ had to have TOP lose all their remaining games in day 8 to stand a chance of making it out via a tie-breaker.
998,"When I realize my viewership is largely driven by spite towards C9 for how they did Sneaky wrong... Ope. 

Maybe one day NA will wake up and realize NA viewers like watching *entertaining* NA talent."
999,hard to get attached to garbage
1000,"It helps when the rookies in LEC are put on good teams and do well often. Most of the real rookies in LCS are put on terrible teams. The other ""rookies"" are imports who if you follow other regions you already have preconceived notions about."

You accidentally spelled ""sexy white girls"" as ""personalities"""
1002,"This.

Players matter, Doublelift and Bjergsen are two of the greatest if not the greatest NA players of all time.

They've carried the teams they've been on for years, when veteran and well known players leave viewership will tank especially if multiple leave at the same time.

Watch what will happen to T1 games viewership when Faker retires."
1003,you're not worth the explanation.
1004,YouTube comment sections. Lmao
1005,"You are technically correct.

But that's not why imports make the LCS suck. It's not that a bunch of people have different legal documents. It's that they don't feel like they're one of us. They don't represent us up on stage. 

On the other hand though, if someone is American in every way but their paperwork they still represent NA pride. So that's why I say Huhi shouldn't be called an import"
1006,Because USA has more disposable income than Brazil. That at the worth of the dollar is a lot more than many other countries.
1007,There was an interview with Liquid112 ~4 years ago where he it's about 2.5x more valuable to market to 1 NA viewer than 1 EU viewer
1008,It goes as far as 20-30x
1009,Yeah newzoo measures it
1010,"But not X10 as valuable as a Frenchman, or from most of the other European regional league which has similar views."
1011,"Yeah, I know website owners and USA traffic is the most valuable. YouTubers will say the same thing. $5 CPM (1,000 USA visitors) you earn $5. Whereas Brazil, Southeast Asia traffic that'll be more like $0.50 CPM (1,000 visitors) will earn you $0.50 (a 10x difference). Europe and East Asia will fall somewhere in between but the USA traffic is the most valuable."
1012,"Vetheo, Adam are definitely major league ready at their first year it's insane.

Also some others are nearly there too like Jezu."
1013,And the second tier french league has way more viewers than na academy too.
1014,"LFL > Unified/EGL

Academy doesn’t exist in Europe, since the LEC doesn’t have a dedicated Reserve League"
1015,Sorry but it doesn't at all. You are comparing a continent of 500m to a country of 70m. Yeah esport is now well developed in France but north America has a huge seniority. It is pathetic to think that it has not made any type of progress in 5-7 years.
1016,"Maybe you are right or maybe it's a completely different reason but nevertheless it feels really wasted. Flash the sponsor on the side and put some content from the teams or do anything else, but at least do something"
1017,"And in regular season set time blocks are pretty good imo, I like knowing at what time the games I really wanna watch happen for when I can't watch a whole evening. In playoffs it should be possible to shorten them a little though."

nowhere near the worst casting duo, which is the PCS's. love the region, but those two cannot sound excited if their lives depended on it. and my pick for underrated casting duo is CBLOL's. not my favorite (that goes to Vedi/Medi/Quickshot booth), but they make every play feel so important with their undying enthusiasm and excitement."
1022,We're all just a bunch of dirty LCS fans when you really think about it
1023,LCS made a big mistake getting rid of (or not re-signing or whatever) Ovilee.
1024,"I hate to say it but the entire LCS production needs to be reworked from the ground up to have any chance of being good.

Shitcan everyone on the desk except Emily and Dash, build a new desk with them as the 2 main figures leading the desk, throw in some proven interviewers who can actually ask insightful questions (aka not fucking letigress) and maybe a few pro players and boom you have a desk. Do that and hire some actual observers and lcs might become watchable. Sometimes I swear games are being played on the autodirector camera it's so bad.


The desk has been phoning it in with very little effort to improve for years now, if they don't care about their jobs why should I care?

The one good thing lcs has is casting, Phreak, Captainflowers etc are completely fine as far as casters go."
1025,"video unavailable for me

i'm assuming you typed a random \ accidentally"
1026,It has no place in a production that is trying to replicate a professional sports broadcast. You would never see it in LEC
1027,"Even as a European I am annoyed by some Europeans acting as if LCS needs to be scheduled according to ""our"" time zones. Sports leagues cater to their domestic audience, LPL and LCK also don't give a shit if they can be viewed in Europe or Africa or NA or wherever.

In fact, LCS might even need to be scheduled 1 or 2 hours later. Compared to all other major regions, LCS still has the earliest starting time, even on the US east coast.

LEC usually starts at 17 or 18 local time (19 or 20 in Eastern Europe, 20 or 21 in the far East), LPL usually starts at 18 local time, LCK starts at 17 local time. Meanwhile, LCS starts usually starts at 13-15 local time, which even on the US east coast is only 16 to 18 o'clock.

If LEC started at a local time as early as LCS, I wouldn't be able to watch most of the matches."
1028,"Personally I wish it was just 1 hour earlier all 3 days.

Instead of 6pm/5pm/4pm Fri/Sat/Sun (which aren't actually accurate because that's never when the games actually start) I was it was 5pm/4pm/3pm."
1029,"I think LCS feels half-arsed a lot of the time. You can tell they get talking points from Reddit, and they leaned so hard into the ‘NA is bad’ rhetoric instead of trying to sell the positives of the league that I think it was actually really harmful 

For a region that made it to MSI finals and worlds semis in recent years and has a bunch of globally recognised talent, I’d expect to see some hype and optimism from the desk, and not the same tired memes about not getting out of groups. Save the memeing for stuff like 0-6 TSM 

Ban all the analysts from Reddit and I bet you see a better broadcast, less the people exposed for having no insights of their own"
1030,">We are missing someone willing to really make a splash and fire up the show, and the way to do it isn't to be this overly professional.

How dry NA is nowadays is still weird to me because back in like 2013/14 you watched NA if you wanted the big personalities."
1031,"> LCS is too... corporate, somehow. Soulless.

Yet the LEC is doing fine with sponsors, so is the LCK post-franchising, the difference is they make it vague and don't shove it in your ass. It destroys viewer experience IMO

Heck, I even watch the LJL and the Japanese ads are a multitude less cringe than NA ads. That's to put it lightly."
1032,"Okay if this is the case then why does French academy and cblol have similar viewership?

1037,"Honestly though, people don't realize that DK + Daeny is a completely different beast. Beginning of summer DK is incomparable to end of summer DK"
1038,"I disagree because 2020 DWG demolished and dismantled the 2nd best team in the world at the time.

The current DWG went 3-1 against T1, and while they still look terrifying (even in their 20 minute loss, they nearly pulled back the game honestly) they still don't look as clean as they did last year.

They might still be the best team in the world, and might still be the best team by far, but I don't currently think they look better than they did last year."
1039,Jokes on you 100T will win 3-1 and you'll turn it on just in time to watch Abbe trip and break the trophy :P
1040,"Even less people will be viewing the weekday matches. The matches are scheduled during the weekend because traditionally, that's when most people actually have time to waste and can stay late into the night. 

People are not giving up their weekend to watch League, people are watching League during the weekend because they think it is a hobby that is worth the time spent."
1041,It's not black and white. It's all those factors combined plus yours combined.
1042,"The region isn't very good but that doesn't explain everything. LoL eSports in Vietnam or Brazil is insanely popular, and the regions are worse. There are many reasons why LCS isn't as popular as LEC, the strength of the region is one, but let's not pretend that the scheduling, the teams/narratives, production etc. don't take a toll on the overall viewership."

1047,"Yeah, it must be so exhausting to hear some words. How terrible for you."
1048,"Ya its just the way the games are set up, they have to start at or after start time. People just like LEC desk more so they act like LCS does more. I personally cant stand LEC desk either so it feels like ages between games."

1052,DK wouldn't be DK if they played in the LCS and NA solo queue for an entire year. How many imports do we have to see decline here for you to finally get it?
1053,Re-read my comment. I think you are misreading things.
1054,No
1055,na bad  upvotes pls
1056,"People downvoting this, but without imports NA would absolutely be on the level of a wildcard region. As is, NA is a retirement home for good EU and KR players who hard carry the region."
1057,"Oh i also agree that H2k run was decent, im just transferring the sentiment of the time. It didnt help that H2k got completely obliterated vs SSG after, if they had put up a fight people wouldnt be so eager to dismiss them"
1058,"H2K winning the group was good, but Nox was exposed by that point. Not even 0-5 G2 lost to them and they were terrible. That game cost them their first seed. 

They managed some competent upsets in bo1 because noone scrimmed them, but then their strategies were known."
1059,"Perkz could have stayed in G2 If they planned with him Mid, or he could have gone to FNC, but G2 blocked that. What NA did in the Bjergsen Transfer-era was ripping the heart out of any team. For example, If you just take Perkz out of 2016 G2 they may end up being relegated and won't evolve into the Org they are now. LCS teams did this plenty of times."
1060,"> I would still rather watch shitty NA talent go against each other than watch imports come here and replicate the same results domestically and internationally.

This is exactly what you said above. Academy is exactly that, shitty NA talent going against each other. So you aren't even consistent from one comment to another. Who is the real idiot here? Protip: It's you."
1061,NA is a clown region that takes good players and makes them washed. I thought it was obvious but americans arent brightest i guess.
1062,Just watch US news. It does get worse
1063,"it got worse, you got old ass marv albert promoting bleacher report and game of zones, webber going on about draftkings and shit"
1064,"There is a big difference. I don't hear ""coca-cola"" penalty scored. Or ""Google"" red card when I'm watching rugby. I can see sponsors on shirts or on the pitch without the commentators mentioning it every 15s. It means you can largely ignore them. You can't ignore them watching the lcs. Granted its effective advertising but it ruins the viewing experience"
1065,You can tune out what you see not what you hear.
1066,"I wouldn't know. There could be many reasons why. You have a much wider international branding and reach (especially on kids) with ""shiny"" clean uniforms, whereas a european football club wouldn't sell much outside it's own country anyway since the other countries also have big local leagues.  
You legitimately think that they wouldn't put sponsors on the uniforms even if it would make them more money in the long run because they don't want to ""sell out""?"
1067,I'm hoping Big Gabe reaches that level soon too. Love his stream
1068,">Sorry if this next part comes off as rude, but may I ask why your opinion matters then?  
  
Because I could be watching LCS, but I am not?  

>Like, if such a small (imo) change was enough to push you out  
  
There's multiple reasons that pushed me out, this was just the tip of the iceberg so to say.  

>-viewers that were never going to stay.  
   
Which is a baseless assumption.  
I've watched insane amount of LoL esports since season 1.  
And I have a history of watching a lot of LCS back in the days.   
  
  
>Taking this sponsorship means +money and -viewers that were never going to stay. Good deal, no?
  
Depends on how many viewers get turned off by it."
1069,and european broadcasters don't have ads? the tv stations that play your soccer games run ad-free?
1070,Most franchises league have a revenue sharing model for broadcast rights and ads. LCS blocked FPX appearing next to TSM for example. So technically yes they are the same.
1071,"What? The image linked is from a European hockey league. Did you just assume it’s the NHL cause hockey? 

The point I’m making is the NHL does not have advertising in that way …"
1072,What is the main sponsor?
1073,"It's just a culture thing. As an American, I *hate* sponsorships on jerseys."
1074,Only on Reddit people have this meaningless regional circlejerk lol.

1077,"Here’s why I think I like it: what’s more important? Is it the amount gold or the gold difference? For 95% of the game it’s the gold difference. I’d much rather see that on my screen than anything else really. FTX is obviously unnecessary, but I don’t really care."
1078,"damn, never knew Quickshot was black!"
1079,Which people?
1080,[removed]
1081,"FBI, Lost, and Closer all made their names in the LCS. Sorry I'm not typing each imports name and just naming the most notable examples. Connection is more than just talking to the fans. Ssumday for instance has stuck with 100 thieves for a long time even through benchings and other rough splits. He hasn't bounced from team to team and has showed strong work ethic.

Perkz will probably always feel like an EU player regardless how much he interacts with the fans. Not every import is liked the same amount nor do they have the same connection. I'm just saying imports aren't the main reason for loss of viewership. LPL has most of their top teams with LCK imports and they are doing fine."
1082,"There’s still a decent amount of ads though, including banners on the rift"
1083,"That’s not what I’m talking about though. Obviously sponsors aren’t necessarily going to raise a teams level of play instantly, there are so many other variables that affect that. What I’m saying is that the sponsors allow the LCS to make money and continue to exist into the future in general. That is undeniably good."
1084,"LEC doesn't have to deal with the harsh reality of a crappy timeslot for international viewers. You're telling me that without all the sponsors, you'd stay up til 3AM to watch CLG vs DIG? If the answer is no, why the hell would the broadcast market for you?"
1085,"I would say they are at least attempting to target American audiences, especially with the later start times to coincide with prime time. That’s not really what I meant with my comment though. I was referencing the ads specifically were done in a way that is “targeted for a NA audience”. Those types of ads and sponsorships may not work as well in Europe but they seem to be more effective here, hence why they are using them."
1086,"Brokenblade finished 10th, but LEC has promoted him a lot and people want to see him succeed"
1087,But all viewers are not equal.  An American viewer will be worth about 2.5x a European viewer.  So if you lose 100k European viewers but gain 50k American viewers then it's a win
1088,doesnt matter truth gets downvoted in this subreddit
1089,A lot of the new rookies are good though so I don't understand why people are so down on them. Spica is great - he just won MVP and has a very outgoing personality. Why aren't there more Spica fans out there?
1090,Sexy =/= good personalities. I don't care how someone looks.
1091,"True, most NA fans are player fans tbh. This year we lost a lot of personalities. Sure we got Perkz but it's hard to care for him(for me anyway) when he got slapped around by pink wards."
1092,It plain doesn't rofl. Sniff on more hopium
1093,What?
1094,"I personally don't care about imports.  LCS could be entirely imports and I wouldn't mind.  I am solely interested in my particular team doing well and don't care about who it is on the team that accomplishes that goal.

I just know Bjergsen, despite appearing/acting as American as any other NA player, was still always called an import and not NA."
1095,"They also have truly insane import taxes.  Video game friendly advertisements probably don’t hit the same when the 3080 costs $3000 USD msrp.

Same story for cars and other imported goods."
1096,yeah ofc also unified langue and one gigantic market
1097,"there is probably no good reason or a singular one that can explain the lacking viewership in NA. it's some mix of fan apathy, poor timing and scheduling (a weekend match starts at 4 on the east coast), perceived inferiority to other major and/or minor regions, lack of NA talents and rookies (from any region. just something to avoid the same rotation of players being transferred from one team to the other.), etc."
1098,"Thing is that even if you take solely the US, you may have 335m people but they're spread accross a huge territory and that'll create some form of differences in terms of interest and culture.   
In France it's 67m people, but not spread out, which means there is less variation.   


The org doing the broadcast has been the same, or the people doing it have been the same for 10 years (They just left Ogaming to create their own thing), and they're doing a lot to actually cater to the viewers.   
Also add to that the fact a lot of LoL streamers actually advertise the LFL, and that's how you get a lot of visibility.  


LoL isn't as big in the US and that won't help, so everything considered, it makes sense."
1099,"From what I've seen in the past few years League is slowly dying in NA as a serious game. Very few of my former highschool/college group really plays anymore and looks like there is little passion for the game compared to China, Korea, EU, etc. 

There's been an interesting increase in the amount of people who still watch League Esports, but loathe playing the game or go ARAM only. Not going to lie I just find the game far less enjoyable compared to S2-5 and from what I see most kids are sucked into Battleroyale games."
1100,The games are meant to start at set times so they have the countdowns to fill space. Since they don't know how much space they will have it's hard for anyone to create adverts for it.
1101,Teams need prep time between games. I don't see them ever agreeing to lower that time.
1102,"Same, I would love some lck merch"
1103,I agree with basically everything except I really like MarkZ and would want to keep him too.
1104,"Link works for me, the title of the video is ""Perkz and Jankos on the analyst desk"". Maybe you can find it that way?"
1105,"if they turned off the model and just had them connect with no webcam would that also have no place?

and has the lcs confirmed that they're trying to replicate a professional broadcast? i know we all say that's what they're trying to do but have they come out and said that as well?

you talk about ""never see it in LEC"" but they literally have animated models of the league champs on stage when they're just chilling"
1106,Oh please god don't schedule NA later.  As East coast I already usually end up skipping the late night games and watch the VODs later. As a 20 something year old (like probably a good chunk of viewers and people here) I like to do shit in the evenings on Friday and Saturday.
1107,"Redditors and being unable to recognise social cues, name a more iconic duo.

No one is demanding the LCS start earlier to accommodate us. They're just LCS fans highlighting that the late scheduling means they can't watch. I'm one of these people, I can maybe watch the first game of each night before I have sleep.

I'm not demanding anything, but as a fan it's a little disappointing for me."
1108,"It's funny cause some european fans are raging that worlds is moved earlier than usual when it's in europe to make it easier for chinese viewers to watch, but when they ask/demand that LCS be moved earlier so they can watch that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do."
1109,"
>leaned so hard into the ‘NA is bad’ rhetoric instead of trying to sell the positives of the league that I think it was actually really harmful 

Fucking lol. When exactly did they do that? That's just a blatant lie."
1110,Ah true.
1111,"Perhaps but if we’re going of the 3-1 to DK and putting MAD and DK on a similar lvl, FNC also lost 3-1. Besides they were getting better and better as playoffs progressed, so I do think things are relatively even outside of DK being an absolute fucking monster team."
1112,"Yeah, that's probably it. I remember when the LCK had the fastest average game time in S9 and S10 (haven't check this year) and people still said false stuff like every game being a Gen.G slow style game."
1113,"Or it will be game 4 and ceiling lights will fall on abbe, forcing Ryoma to sub in Game 5 :D"
1114,"Kinda weird, dude. I'm just explaining my position. Feel free to think differently. This isn't what I want, so it's what I express."
1115,"Well, for me personally it just annoys me, so I dislike it. I hate the increasing commercialisation all around the world, be it in YT video sponsorships, E-sports franchising and the associated increase of sponsors and just generally outside the digital world. I have no interest in watching your ads, especially if they are in the context of NA, where most of the adverts are for stuff I just flat out won't ever buy in my life (such as state farm, or beer, or cars). It is just annoying."
1116,I think you are both misunderstanding each other. He means if world's males it easier for EU to have personalities how come a lot of the personalities have never even made it to world's.
1117,With how it plays it is?
1118,NA is bad though.
1119,"If you removed all imports today then maybe? But in another world where NA didn't import players like Finn, Broxah, Dreams and Raes(lol) and instead used those slots to develop their own talent they'd still be above wildcard regions due to infrastructure alone

Even right now a full NA team of Licorice/Spica/Ablaze/Tactical or Danny/Vulcan would still smash play-in teams"
1120,Even with imports and money they are still wild card level tbh
1121,"I'm aware, my point is that it hasn't gotten much better. The only difference is what I mentioned, we now have players like Caps who know what the LEC is capable of and put a lot of value on that. Value that no LCS team can match.


So yes, it's gotten a bit better in the past few years, but it's still bad."
1122,"LOL! Yes, shitty talent go against each other in the LCS. We haven't once talked about Academy, well other than you trying to be an idiot. 

There are very clearly different stakes in the LCS compared to Academy. You know that, I know that and everyone else knows that. But instead of just being a good little boy and admit when you're wrong, you like to argue on Reddit to try and prove your superiority. 

I'm guessing your compensating for something.

If you can't tell the difference between Academy and LCS, there is truly one idiot here. Protip: it's you."
1123,Uh... the term '***tune*** *out*' specifically refers to audio.
1124,"I don't know what you're trying to say, it's not at all connected to what me or the person I was trying to said."
1125,"Nobody in EU gives a fuck about hocky, that's imported bullshit from North America and is not representative of our sporting culture. 

The most popular team sports (football & rugby) will have 1-2 advertisements on the kit itself which will typically be the clothing company that designs the kit (Nike\\Adidas\\Puma\\Umbro\\etc) and then the a more whoever the main sponsor of the club is. Example of a Liverpool kit [https://images.sportsdirect.com/images/products/37840818\_l.jpg](https://images.sportsdirect.com/images/products/37840818_l.jpg)"

The LCS is just worse from a broadcast point of view.  The LEC is genuinely entertaining. if you removed league games from the LEC and the LCS the LEC would be far more enjoyable to watch and that’s without getting into the in game bullshit sponsorships"
1131,I'm not sure who you think from NA actually likes hearing sponsor names in callouts but I sure as hell hate it as someone from NA and it certainly doesn't make me want to use FTX because I hear FTX gold advantage.

1133,"I was/am a doublelift fan, not a CLG fan, or a TSM fan, or a TL fan.

with DL gone i lost interest in the league, only popping back for the occasional game and playoffs. Tried to watch and get invested in some teams through TSM Legends/other team equivalents, but its like the soul of the league is gone without DL/Bjerg."
1134,"You think there isn't big cultural differences between populations in France depending on origins or locations ?

1140,You can clearly see the average LCS/LEC fan don't watch LCK. Just from the statement: “LCK still plays extremely scared”. Literally the top 4 teams have been head to toe in teamfights and early skirmishes the whole split. They have literally adapted to the Damwon gameplay in 2020. Gonna be fun watching these fans surprised at worlds :)
1141,"And I'm just explaining my position that It's kind of a silly to be 'exhausted' because they throw in a few extra words here and there.

Yeah ads are boring. But it's not a charity. If it's content you enjoy for free, then hearing 'Red Bull' thrown in every now and then really shouldn't be a big deal."
1142,So you think they should run a charity?
1143,"> It's way easier to build up personalities when your region performs at international events.

This is my initial statement. If your region performs well, fans will be more interested in learning about the players. I'm not sure how his statement is different from mine. E.g. Treatz got no attention in the LCS because the region sucked internationally and fans didn't want to learn about a new player in a bad region. Then when Treatz went back to EU, fans in EU like learning about new developing talent for a region that can perform well internationally.

Would LCS get the same viewership numbers if the broadcast swapped regions? I don't think so."
1144,"No chance. You're forgetting that if NA never imports, all the players that taught our region how to play stay in their own regions and level them up instead. EU with Bjerg Jensen POE Zven Mithy Sven Perkz, Korea with Huni Reignover CoreJJ Ssumday etc, would absolutely demolish NA 100 times out of 100. NA might be the best wildcard team, though Albus nox luna says otherwise lmao, but they'd still be a wildcard team."
1145,you implied european broadcasters don't have sponsors? but they do?

1148,LeBoring is awful.
1149,"Guess I need to clarify, by international I mean EU viewers watching NA and NA viewers watching EU. There's a *lot* of overlap between viewers who would/do watch the two leagues, while LPL and LCK are much more isolated from the west. 

You've completely missed the point btw, regardless of the quality of broadcast, the guy I responded to was talking about how the LCS doesn't market for european viewers atm, and my point was that the timeslot means a lot of that promo would be wasted because the timeslot just doesn't work for a lot of the EU. Comparatively, I'm on the west coast and LEC starts up around 9 AM, which is *super* doable when I'm not working. A lot of NA viewers share my situation I'm sure."
1150,"Maybe it wasn't clear, but as a french I do believe I kinda know how it works out. 
While there is a difference in cultural background (customs mostly), the main part of the culture remains quite the same (barring maybe Alsace Lorraine since it's a really special case and even then it's not that much). 

If you compare the main cultural points between Texas, California, New Jersey and shit like that, you'll see that they can be heavily divided (as a result also of how the political part of the country works out).
Being recent doesn't really mean as much, especially when the US has seen difficulties when it comes to unity throughout their whole history."
1151,"There isn't one there, and I can click it just fine. Must be a problem with your browser."
1152,How come literally every other region can start in the evening with no problem?
1153,Theyre not going to admit that they are at fault. Just turn a blind eye and repeat the same shit in 2022. Western fans i swear
1154,Even if EU didn't do well at world's people would still care about the personalities because they are given way more time by the production. Even the regional leagues have bigger personalities than the LCS.
1155,Huni has a strong chance of not getting any recognition if he didn't prove himself in EU and NA first.
1156,"Most of the imports that come to NA were already on a steady decline and would most likely been replaced in their own league in a year's time. Throughout LCS' history there's been far more Seraph's, Avalon, Ninja's and Finn's than a CoreJJ. People like Core level up the region but the former players stagnate the region if not outright make it worse

Not that it's relevant since we're talking about minor regions, where NA would very clearly still be on top. They'd get smashed by the major regions and beat the minor ones, so basically the same as right now

>NA might be the best wildcard team, though Albus nox luna says otherwise lmao, but they'd still be a wildcard team.

We've had full NA teams made QFs with a much stronger showings than ANX(s3/s4 C9), and s6 CLG made MSI finals with 4/5 NA players, with their import being Huhi lol"
1157,"Hmm, I don't think that's what I implied, and I'm not really sure how you even made the assumption... OP said they'd rather have sponsored segments (broadcast) instead of sponsored kits (team).

All I was saying is that they aren't the same, as in the teams decide for themselves who sponsors them, while the broadcasters decide who sponsors them. There's no point saying you'd rather have something when it's not an either/or situation."
1158,"Maybe it’s more of a common thing in NA sports, It’s just so jarring to see all these inserted adverts to me"

1164,"> Avalon

Why do you have to reopen that wound?"
1165,"Yeah there are bad imports, but their replacements are not going to be any better. Native talent has been removed from every role because they simply couldn't keep up. It's been proven over years of LCS that NA talent is simply worse than every other major region.

true forgot CLG used to be good, can you blame me lol"
1166,"I totally get it, and I likely to will hit that point. Right now, I’m fine with mostly all of them. I would say I’m much more of a side monitor kinda of viewer for most games anyways. 

Also, I like when LCS gets sponsors, otherwise I’m not sure it’d still exist haha"
1167,"Do you really believe that on most core questions, the answer will vary as much between two french people from different region the same way it will in the US ? 
Culture might not have been the best term as it might be too broad, but in terms of market it's easier to convince both a Breton and a Basque rather than a Texan and a Californian, and that's the point. 

There is a reason why the US marketing is vastly different between two states compared to France not having as much differences between regions."

1169,I doubt it because league is more popular in Europe but I think that the viewership would still be down because of the production.
1170,"I have to disagree. I just don't see what makes a Texan and a Californian more different than a Breton and an Alsacian. On the contrary, given the history and cultural depth of those people, I'd say they are even more culturally different ! Alsacian gastronomy and Breton gastronomy have absolutely nothing in common, they both have strong non-french languages ties, and they even have a very different economy ! Hell, they don't even have the same kind of cheese or butter !

Just like someone from Lille and someone from Nice are just two worlds apart ! Try to market something to both, it's as difficult as between two people from the US !"
1171,"Again, not disagreeing broadcast can be better and increase viewership but that's just a drop in the bucket at fixing the major issues. Even the LEC broadcasters wouldn't stop the hemorrhaging of viewers."
1172,"Then agree to disagree. 
Your ""best exemple"" are about gastronomy when I made clear that it wasn't really about that part of culture that I meant. 

If you put a Texan and Californian (I took 2 big opposites to even make it clearer) in the same room, and ask them the same question (towards marketing mostly, not about the meaning of life), then repeat the process with different people but from the same states, you're most likely to end up with ideas clashing in general.
If you take a Lillois and Niçois and do the same, do you really believe that on most core subjects you'll have the same amount of disparity ? 

If it's to once again give the same answer that doesn't really turn around the point, I think that we'll both agree that the discussion won't really need to go on as it won't go further."
